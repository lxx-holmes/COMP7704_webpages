        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin declined slightly (17.8% in 2023 vs. 18.3% in 2022) due to rising commodity/input costs and expenses, partially offset by productivity savings.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin remained stable (22.1% in 2023 vs. 22.2% in 2022) as productivity-driven cost savings balanced higher manufacturing/overhead costs.  <br>- ROA decreased modestly (12.1% in 2023 vs. 12.5% in 2022) as asset base growth outpaced earnings, influenced by depreciation of property/equipment.  <br>- ROE declined marginally (31.0% in 2023 vs. 31.3% in 2022) due to foreign exchange fluctuations and increased expenses impacting net earnings.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin improved (47.9% in 2023 vs. 47.5% in 2022) driven by higher pricing (+430 basis points) and manufacturing productivity savings (+150 basis points).  <br>- SG&A expenses rose 50 basis points to 25.7% of net sales in 2023 from increased overhead costs and foreign exchange charges, despite productivity offsets.  <br>- Effective tax rate increased 190 basis points to 19.7% in 2023 due to lower tax benefits from share-based compensation and reduced foreign income deductions.  <br>- Overall profitability stability reflected balanced cost management against inflationary pressures, with asset utilization efficiency slightly pressured by expanded asset base.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 0.654 (2022) to 0.634 (2023) as current liabilities growth ($33.1B to $35.8B) outpaced current assets ($21.7B to $22.6B), driven by increased accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and short-term debt.  <br>- Quick ratio decreased from 0.445 to 0.435 due to higher accounts receivable ($5.1B to $5.5B) and inventory levels ($6.9B to $7.1B), coupled with slower collections (DSO increased by ~1 day).  <br>- Cash ratio improved marginally from 0.218 to 0.230 as cash reserves grew from $7.2B to $8.2B, but remained insufficient to offset rising short-term obligations.  <br>- Short-term debt rose significantly from $8.6B (2022) to $10.2B (2023), contributing to increased current liabilities and liquidity pressure.  <br>- Operating cash flow increased slightly from $16.7B to $16.8B, while financing activities used $12.1B for dividends and share repurchases, reducing available liquidity.  <br>- Working capital management challenges included inventory buildup and slower receivables conversion, despite partial offset from increased accounts payable financing.  <br>- Accrued and other liabilities surged from $9.6B to $10.9B, reflecting timing differences in expense recognition and contractual obligations.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio increased from 1.50 (2022) to 1.57 (2023) due to higher total liabilities ($73,764M vs. $70,354M) outpacing modest equity growth ($47,065M vs. $46,854M), signaling increased debt reliance.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio declined from 40.95 to 24.23 as interest expenses rose faster than EBIT ($756M vs. $439M interest, $18,353M vs. $17,995M EBIT).  <br>- Debt-to-Asset Ratio remained stable at 0.60 (2022) to 0.61 (2023), reflecting proportional debt growth with total assets ($120,829M vs. $117,208M).  <br>- Higher leverage aligns with capital structure strategy, supported by interest rate swaps to manage rate exposure, as noted in financial disclosures.  <br>- Robust internal controls and unqualified auditor opinion ensure financial data reliability for ratio calculations.  <br>- Despite increased debt and lower interest coverage, solvency remains stable with manageable debt levels and no over-extension relative to assets.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO increased from 23.4 to 24.3 days in 2023, reflecting slower customer collections due to economic pressures like inflation and recession impacting payment cycles.  <br>- DIO improved slightly (59.9 to 59.7 days) driven by supply chain optimizations and adjusted safety stock levels for better inventory turnover.  <br>- DPO decreased from 128.8 to 124.4 days as lower commodity/transportation costs and extended supplier payment terms via financing programs enabled faster settlements.  <br>- CCC became less negative (-45.5 to -40.4 days) due to higher DSO and reduced DPO, signaling a marginal efficiency decline despite maintaining strong cash flow management.  <br>- Economic risks (inflation, geopolitical tensions) strained customer payment capabilities and supplier relationships, affecting working capital dynamics.  <br>- Supply chain improvements, including inventory alignment with demand and safety stock strategies, supported DIO efficiency.  <br>- Restructuring initiatives (workforce adjustments, supply chain streamlining) influenced both inventory turnover and payable management.  <br>- PG retains overall working capital efficiency with a negative CCC, though 2023 challenges highlight tighter cash conversion cycle management in volatile conditions.
