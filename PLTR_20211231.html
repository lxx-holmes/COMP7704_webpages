          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross profit margin improved from 67.7% (2020) to 78% (2021) due to $71.1M reduction in stock-based compensation and operational efficiencies in deployment costs.  <br>- Operating profit margin rose from -107.4% to -26.7%, driven by reduced sales/marketing (-10%), R&D (-31%), and G&A (-9%) expenses.  <br>- Net profit margin improved from -106.8% to -33.7% through cost management and operational efficiency gains.  <br>- ROA increased from -43.3% to -16%, and ROE from -76.6% to -22.7%, reflecting better asset/equity utilization despite ongoing losses.  <br>- Government contribution margin increased from 57% to 60%, and commercial from 51% to 55%, supported by 47% government/34% commercial revenue growth.  <br>- Total revenue grew 41% ($1.54B in 2021 vs $1.09B in 2020), with $279.2M government revenue increase from existing customer expansion.  <br>- Cost reductions included $13.1M decrease in production expenses and platform investments improving operational efficiency.  <br>- Company remains unprofitable but shows progress through reduced losses, margin improvements, and disciplined expense management.  <br>- Stock-based compensation cuts and deployment cost optimizations contributed to gross margin expansion.  <br>- Continued focus on cost control and operational efficiency required for sustained profitability.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved from 3.74 (2020) to 4.34 (2021) as current assets grew by $606k, driven by higher cash ($2.29M vs $2.01M), addition of $234k in marketable securities, and increased accounts receivable ($191k vs $157k).  <br>- Quick ratio matched current ratio in both years (4.34 in 2021, 3.74 in 2020), indicating minimal or no inventory holdings, with all current assets being highly liquid.  <br>- Cash ratio rose from 3.33 to 3.47, reflecting a $279k increase in cash reserves, enhancing the ability to cover short-term obligations without relying on asset sales.  <br>- Total current assets increased from $2.26M to $2.86M, supported by growth in cash, marketable securities (new $234k holding), and accounts receivable ($33k increase).  <br>- Improved cash flow management prioritized liquidity, with marketable securities additions and higher cash reserves underscoring a focus on financial stability.  <br>- Despite a $56k rise in current liabilities (to $660k in 2021), asset growth outpaced liability increases, reducing leverage and strengthening liquidity ratios.  <br>- Strong liquidity positions ($3.47 cash ratio in 2021) provide a buffer against short-term financial risks and reflect disciplined cash management practices.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio improved from 0.77 (2020) to 0.42 (2021) due to $200 million debt repayment under the 2014 Credit Facility and equity growth from preferred stock conversion during the 2020 direct listing.  <br>- Solvency ratio (Total Liabilities/Total Equity) decreased from 0.77 to 0.42, reflecting reduced liabilities and increased equity from debt reduction and stock conversion initiatives.  <br>- Interest coverage ratio remained negative at -12.1x (2021 vs. -83.6x in 2020) due to insufficient earnings before interest to cover expenses, despite lower interest costs from reduced debt.  <br>- Reduced debt levels and strengthened equity position enhanced financial stability and long-term viability, lowering creditor/investor risk.  <br>- Persistent negative interest coverage highlights ongoing profitability challenges, with earnings failing to meet interest obligations despite improved leverage metrics.  <br>- Mixed financial health: Debt reduction efforts improved solvency, but inability to generate sufficient operating earnings remains a critical concern for long-term sustainability.

          - DSO improved from 52.4 days (2020) to 45.2 days (2021), reflecting faster receivables collection through enhanced cash flow management and operational efficiency despite a $34K increase in accounts receivable.  <br>- DPO surged 63.7 days to 80.6 days (2021), indicating strategic supplier payment delays supported by $38.3K deferred revenue growth, though accrued liabilities decreased marginally from $158.5K to $155.8K.  <br>- Missing DIO data prevents full CCC calculation, limiting cash cycle analysis; inventory metrics are unavailable due to the company's software/services focus rather than physical product operations.  <br>- Cash reserves increased 13.9% to $2.29M (2021), partially attributed to improved collections and extended payables, demonstrating liquidity prioritization for potential growth initiatives.  <br>- Extended DPO raises supplier relationship risks despite cash retention benefits, requiring careful balance between working capital optimization and vendor management.
