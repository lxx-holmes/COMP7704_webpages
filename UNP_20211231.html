          - No significant changes (greater than ¬±5%) in percentage of total revenue or assets/liabilities composition between 2020-2021.  <br>- Total revenue increased 11.62% ($19,533M to $21,804M) with operating income up 19.21% ($7,834M to $9,338M) and net income rising 21.94% ($5,349M to $6,523M).  <br>- Total shareholders' equity decreased 16.48% ($16,958M to $14,161M) year-over-year.  <br>- Double-digit growth across all key income metrics occurred without major shifts in revenue/expense proportions.  <br>- Shareholders' equity reduction contrasts with strong operational performance improvements.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin increased from 27.4% (2020) to 30.0% (2021), driven by 11.6% revenue growth and effective expense management.  <br>- Operating profit margin rose from 39.9% to 42.8%, reflecting controlled operating expenses, particularly reduced fuel and compensation costs.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) improved from 8.6% to 10.3%, indicating enhanced asset utilization through operational excellence initiatives.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) surged from 31.6% to 46.1%, partly due to reduced total equity (from $16,958M to $14,161M) alongside profit growth.  <br>- Revenue expansion and cost containment strategies contributed to margin improvements across all profitability metrics.  <br>- Equity reduction amplified ROE performance despite being a balance sheet adjustment rather than operational improvement.  <br>- Operational efficiency gains and disciplined expense management supported simultaneous growth in profits and margins.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio dropped from 1.010 (2020) to 0.619 (2021), quick ratio from 0.856 to 0.510, and cash ratio from 0.431 to 0.167 due to 47% cash reserve decline and 37% current liabilities increase.  <br>- Cash and equivalents fell from $1,799M (2020) to $960M (2021), reducing cash coverage of short-term obligations.  <br>- Working capital shifted from surplus (2020 COVID precautionary cash) to deficit (2021) driven by upcoming debt maturities.  <br>- $7.3B share repurchases and $2.8B dividends drained cash reserves despite $9.0B operating cash flow generation.  <br>- Debt exchange ($1.7B) and long-term issuance ($3.5B) increased overall debt burden while short-term liquidity remained pressured.  <br>- Reduced COVID-19 uncertainty in 2021 led to lower cash holdings compared to 2020's elevated pandemic reserves.  <br>- Management relied on credit facilities to meet obligations, highlighting liquidity strain from imbalanced cash deployment.  <br>- Current ratio below 1 (0.619) in 2021 reflects insufficient current assets to cover $3.4B current liabilities.  <br>- Operational cash flow prioritized for shareholder returns rather than liquidity maintenance, exacerbating cash position decline.  <br>- Combined 37% current liabilities growth and 47% cash reduction strained ratios, requiring urgent working capital management focus.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased from 2.68 (2020) to 3.48 (2021) due to $3.5B long-term debt issuance, $1.7B debt exchange, and $7.3B share repurchases reducing equity.  <br>- Total liabilities rose from $45,440M (2020) to $49,364M (2021), while equity fell from $16,958M to $14,161M.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio improved from 8.81x (2020) to 9.97x (2021) as EBIT increased (+$1,504M) while interest expense remained stable ($1,141M to $1,157M).  <br>- Share repurchases of $7.3B in 2021 outweighed $6,523M net income, driving equity reduction despite profitability.  <br>- Solvency ratio (liabilities/equity) worsened from 2.68 (2020) to 3.48 (2021), reflecting increased reliance on debt financing.  <br>- Liquidity remains strong with operating cash flow and credit facilities, but higher leverage elevates financial risk.  <br>- Debt strategy aimed to refinance and lower interest costs, while equity reduction prioritized shareholder returns via buybacks and dividends.  <br>- Mixed solvency trends: improved interest coverage contrasts with higher leverage, requiring monitoring of long-term stability.

          - DSO increased from 28.1 days (2020) to 28.9 days (2021), indicating a slight slowdown in accounts receivable collection but minimal cash flow impact.  <br>- DIO dropped from 71.0 days (2020) to 55.8 days (2021), reflecting faster inventory turnover and improved inventory management, freeing cash.  <br>- DPO decreased from 345.6 days (2020) to 321.4 days (2021), suggesting faster supplier payments that may strain cash flow but signal tighter cash management.  <br>- CCC improved from -246.5 days (2020) to -236.7 days (2021), driven by inventory efficiency and payables control, maintaining reliance on supplier financing.  <br>- Cash/cash equivalents fell from $1,799M (2020) to $960M (2021) despite higher net income and operating cash flow, indicating robust profitability and active cash allocation.  <br>- Financial statements cite enhanced internal controls and management practices as contributors to improved working capital efficiency.  <br>- Negative CCC underscores effective use of supplier credit to fund operations, with reduced cycle intensity reflecting balanced cash flow optimization.

        Union Pacific Corporation demonstrated strong financial performance in 2021 with significant increases in total revenue, operating income, and net income. The improvement in profitability ratios such as net profit margin, operating profit margin, ROA, and ROE indicates enhanced efficiency. Share buybacks reduced the number of shares outstanding, which, combined with continued revenue growth and expense management, is expected to boost EPS. Despite concerns about liquidity and higher debt levels, the company's efficient cash management and industry tailwinds suggest that EPS will increase next year.
