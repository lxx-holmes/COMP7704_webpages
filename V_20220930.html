          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin remained stable at 51.1% (2022 vs. 2021) as 21.6% revenue growth was offset by a 26% operating expense increase.  <br>- Operating profit margin declined slightly from 65.6% to 64.2% due to operating expenses outpacing revenue growth.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) improved from 14.9% to 17.5%, reflecting enhanced asset efficiency and a higher asset turnover ratio (0.343 vs. 0.291).  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) rose significantly from 32.8% to 42.0%, driven by better equity utilization and increased net income.  <br>- Asset turnover ratio increased 18% (0.291 to 0.343), indicating more effective use of assets to generate revenue growth.  <br>- Operating expenses grew faster (26%) than revenues (21.6%), creating margin pressure despite absolute profit growth.  <br>- Overall profitability remained strong with improved capital efficiency (ROA/ROE) and stable net margins, balancing expense challenges.

          - Current ratio declined from 1.75 (2021) to 1.45 (2022) due to a $15.7B to $20.9B increase in current liabilities, but remains above 1 indicating stable short-term coverage capacity.  <br>- Quick ratio decreased from 1.70 to 1.32, reflecting increased reliance on less liquid assets like inventory/prepaids to meet obligations.  <br>- Cash ratio dropped below 1 (0.75 vs 1.05) as cash reserves fell from $16.5B to $15.7B, signaling reduced immediate liquidity but maintaining reasonable coverage levels.  <br>- Liquidity pressures intensified from $35M pre-tax loss from Russian operations suspension and $11.6B share repurchases/acquisition investments.  <br>- Debt restructuring through new issuances and senior note repayments contributed to cash flow volatility.  <br>- Current liability growth (+33%) outpaced cash preservation efforts, necessitating closer working capital monitoring despite overall liquidity stability.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio rose from 1.20 (2021: $45,307M liabilities / $37,589M equity) to 1.40 (2022: $49,920M liabilities / $35,581M equity), driven by ‚Ç¨3.0B Euro-denominated debt issuance and $1.0B maturing note repayments (Note 10).  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio improved from 30.82 (2021: $15,804M operating income / $513M interest) to 34.96 (2022: $18,813M operating income / $538M interest) due to strong operating income growth.  <br>- Total equity declined by $2,008M (2021: $37,589M to 2022: $35,581M), partly from deconsolidating Visa‚Äôs Russian subsidiary ($35M pre-tax loss) and foreign currency impacts (Note 1).  <br>- Solvency Ratio (Total Liabilities/Equity) mirrored Debt-to-Equity trends, rising from 1.20 (2021) to 1.40 (2022), reflecting increased financial risk from higher debt levels.  <br>- Improved operating income (+19% YoY to $18,813M) offset rising debt, enhancing debt service capacity despite higher absolute interest expenses ($538M vs. $513M in 2021).  <br>- Foreign currency adjustments from suspended Russian operations contributed to equity reduction and debt-equity ratio pressure (Note 1).  <br>- Debt reliance increased in 2022, but robust earnings growth maintained stable financial health with interest coverage exceeding 30x in both years.

          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved from 18.1 days (2021) to 13.3 days (2022), driven by a 4.7-day reduction in Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) from 29.8 to 25.1 days, reflecting faster receivables collection and enhanced operational efficiency.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) remained stable at 11.7‚Äì11.8 days, indicating consistent supplier payment management without significantly delaying payables.  <br>- CCC reduction of 4.8 days demonstrates improved liquidity and working capital efficiency, supported by Visa's disciplined cash flow practices.  <br>- Faster DSO highlights stronger customer payment processes, directly boosting cash flow health and aligning with liquidity optimization goals.  <br>- Stable DPO balances supplier relationships with cash preservation, maintaining financial flexibility while avoiding excessive payment delays.  <br>- Overall CCC enhancement signals effective operational controls, positioning Visa for sustained growth through optimized working capital cycles.
