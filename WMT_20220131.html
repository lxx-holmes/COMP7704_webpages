          - No significant changes (greater than ¬±5%) in percentage of total revenue for any line items between 2022 and 2021.  <br>- Income from Operations increased 15.06% YoY (from $22,548M to $25,942M), the only significant revenue-related growth.  <br>- All other key financial metrics showed YoY changes within ¬±10%.  <br>- Inventories rose from 17.8% to 23.1% of Total Assets (+5.3 percentage points).  <br>- Prepaid expenses and other fell from 8.3% to 0.6% of Total Assets (-7.7 percentage points).  <br>- Receivables, net increased from 2.6% to 3.4% of Total Assets (+0.8 percentage points).  <br>- Accrued liabilities decreased from 15.1% to 10.7% of Total Liabilities & Equity (-4.4 percentage points).  <br>- Short-term borrowings increased from 0.09% to 0.17% of Total Liabilities & Equity (+0.08 percentage points).  <br>- Total Assets decreased 3.1% YoY (from $252,496M to $244,860M).  <br>- Total Liabilities decreased 5.4% YoY (from $164,965M to $156,969M).  <br>- Total Shareholders‚Äô Equity increased 5.1% YoY (from $87,531M to $91,891M).

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin decreased slightly from 2.41% to 2.39%, influenced by divestitures in the UK and Japan introducing one-time costs.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin improved from 4.03% to 4.53%, driven by better cost control and eCommerce/omni-channel investments enhancing operational efficiency.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin rose marginally from 24.29% to 24.43% due to optimized inventory management and reduced markdowns.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) increased from 5.36% to 5.58%, reflecting enhanced asset utilization through strategic property/equipment investments.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) declined from 15.43% to 14.87% due to equity growth from retained earnings or share issuance diluting returns.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin's 0.5 percentage point increase (4.03% to 4.53%) highlights Walmart's focus on operational efficiency despite external challenges.  <br>- ROE decrease of 0.56 percentage points underscores the impact of expanded equity bases on shareholder returns.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 0.972 (2021) to 0.927 (2022) due to higher inventory investments and steeper current asset decline ($90.07B‚Üí$81.07B) versus liabilities ($92.65B‚Üí$87.38B).  <br>- Quick ratio dropped from 0.262 to 0.252 as cash/cash equivalents fell 17% ($17.74B‚Üí$14.76B), with $4.3B internationally restricted (Note 1).  <br>- Cash ratio decreased from 0.192 to 0.169 due to $13.1B capital expenditures and $9.8B share buybacks reducing liquid reserves.  <br>- Inventory increased significantly, lowering quick assets despite being a current asset (excluded from quick ratio calculation).  <br>- $2.2B in Flipkart-related cash required regulatory approval for transfer, contributing to 50% of total cash held internationally (up from 40% in 2021).  <br>- Divestitures (Asda/Seiyu sales) redirected cash to debt repayment/share repurchases rather than liquidity reserves (Note 12).  <br>- Operational efficiency efforts prioritized working capital optimization over maintaining high cash reserves, impacting short-term liquidity metrics.  <br>- Declining ratios reflect strategic cash allocation to investments/shareholder returns despite reduced near-term financial flexibility.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio decreased from 1.88 (2021) to 1.67 (2022) due to $6.6 billion long-term debt reduction, including early extinguishment of high-interest debt, and equity increases from share buybacks and $3.2 billion Flipkart stock sale.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio rose from 10.17 to 15.77, driven by lower interest expenses from new debt issued at 1.05%-1.50% rates and improved operating cash flow supporting debt servicing capacity.  <br>- Solvency ratio improved from 1.53 to 1.60 as cash reserves grew to $14.8 billion (2022) and total liabilities decreased through strategic debt repayment and working capital optimization.  <br>- $6.945 billion in new low-interest long-term debt was issued while $13.01 billion of existing debt was repaid/retired, reducing refinancing risk and interest burden.  <br>- Short-term borrowings plummeted from $4.048 billion (2021) to $0.716 billion (2022), enhancing liquidity and reducing near-term repayment obligations.  <br>- Proactive capital structure management included selling non-core assets (Flipkart shares) and prioritizing early retirement of high-cost debt to optimize financial flexibility.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO increased from 4.27 days (2021) to 5.33 days (2022) due to slower receivables collection, supported by rising net receivables from $2.7B to $3.4B.  <br>- DIO rose from 39 days (2021) to 48 days (2022) reflecting inventory turnover delays, driven by inventory growth from $44.9B to $56.5B indicating potential overstocking or weaker demand.  <br>- DPO increased from 42.6 days (2021) to 47 days (2022) as accounts payable rose from $49.1B to $55.2B, extending supplier payment terms to retain cash.  <br>- CCC improved from 0.67 days (2021) to 6.33 days (2022) primarily due to the extended DPO offsetting DSO/DIO increases, enhancing cash conversion efficiency despite operational slowdowns.  <br>- Strategic shifts including eCommerce expansion, omni-channel initiatives, and divestitures (e.g., Asda, Seiyu) contributed to inventory management challenges and cash flow adjustments.  <br>- Mixed efficiency signals: While CCC improvement reflects stronger cash management, slower receivables collection and inventory turnover require operational review to sustain long-term efficiency.

        Walmart's revenue has been steadily increasing, and the company has shown improvement in operating margins and solvency. Despite some challenges like higher costs and a slight decrease in net profit margin, the overall operational efficiency and revenue growth are expected to positively impact EPS. Additionally, effective management of debt and improved cash flow contribute to a favorable outlook for next year's earnings.
