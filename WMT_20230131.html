          - Total revenue increased by 6.73% ($572,754M to $611,289M) year-over-year, while income from operations declined 21.25% ($25,942M to $20,428M) and net income decreased 14.58% ($13,673M to $11,680M).  <br>- Cash/cash equivalents fell significantly from 6.0% to 3.5% of total assets (-2.5 percentage points), and total current assets decreased from 33.1% to 31.1% (-2.0 percentage points).  <br>- Total current liabilities increased from 35.7% to 38.0% of total liabilities/equity (+2.3 percentage points), while Walmart shareholders' equity declined from 34.0% to 31.5% (-2.5 percentage points).  <br>- Total assets decreased 0.7% year-over-year (not significant), with liabilities increasing 2.8% and shareholders' equity decreasing 8.85% (below 10% significance threshold).  <br>- No material changes (>¬±5%) in revenue composition percentages between 2022 and 2023 were identified.  <br>- Asset/liability structure shows liquidity pressures through reduced cash reserves, lower current assets, and higher current liabilities despite stable overall asset/liability growth rates.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin decreased from 2.39% (2022) to 1.91% (2023), driven by divestiture-related losses (Asda/Seiyu sales) and external economic pressures, reducing income conversion efficiency.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin declined from 25.09% to 24.13%, reflecting inflation-driven cost increases and supply chain challenges impacting cost of goods sold.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin dropped sharply from 4.53% to 3.34% due to rising operating expenses from e-commerce investments, omni-channel initiatives, and potential labor cost increases.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) fell from 5.58% to 4.80%, indicating less efficient asset utilization linked to divestiture-related asset write-downs and reduced net income.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) slightly decreased from 14.87% to 13.94% despite stock buybacks, as net income declines from divestitures and cost pressures outweighed equity reduction benefits.  <br>- All profitability ratios declined, signaling operational inefficiencies from higher costs, strategic investments, and $2.7B in divestiture pre-tax losses per Note 12 disclosures.  <br>- External factors including inflation, recessionary risks, and shifting consumer spending patterns exacerbated margin compression across revenue and cost structures.  <br>- Asset utilization challenges emerged from reduced operational scale post-divestitures, impacting returns despite revenue growth in core segments.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current Ratio declined from 0.93 (2022) to 0.82 (2023), driven by a $4.8B increase in current liabilities (reaching $92,198M) and reduced cash reserves.  <br>- Quick Ratio fell from 0.28 (2022) to 0.21 (2023) due to a $6.1B drop in cash/cash equivalents and less liquid current asset composition.  <br>- Cash Ratio dropped sharply from 0.169 (2022) to 0.093 (2023) as cash reserves decreased 41.6% ($14,760M to $8,625M), partly from $17.7B in 2023 investments/acquisitions versus $6.0B in 2022.  <br>- $3.3B accrued liability for opioid-related lawsuits contributed to rising current liabilities, exacerbating liquidity pressures.  <br>- 62% of 2023 cash held outside the U.S. (some non-transferable), reducing readily available liquidity.  <br>- Shift in current assets toward less liquid components (e.g., inventory, receivables) weakened Quick Ratio without inventory reliance.  <br>- Operational cash flow challenges emerged from increased capital expenditures and reduced cash flexibility for short-term obligations.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Walmart's debt-to-equity ratio increased from 1.66 (2022) to 1.90 (2023) due to a $4.969 billion long-term debt issuance in September 2022, increasing total liabilities to $159,206M and reducing equity to $83,754M.  <br>- Interest coverage ratio declined from 14.13 to 10.91 times as EBIT fell from $25,942M to $20,428M (2023) despite stable interest expenses ($1,874M vs. $1,836M), reflecting lower profitability.  <br>- Debt-to-asset ratio rose from 62% to 65% as liabilities grew to $159,206M against assets of $243,197M, driven by net debt increases from new borrowings and repayments.  <br>- Long-term debt increased by $1.2 billion in 2023, contributing to higher financial leverage and reduced solvency buffer, though interest coverage remains strong.  <br>- Asset base slightly decreased from $244,860M (2022) to $243,197M (2023), amplifying the impact of liability growth on debt-to-asset metrics.  <br>- While Walmart maintains operational capacity to service debt, increased reliance on debt financing and lower EBIT warrant closer monitoring of leverage trends.

          - DSO decreased from 13.8 to 12.4 days in 2023, reflecting improved collections due to stricter credit policies or early payment incentives.  <br>- DIO declined from 47.8 to 44.6 days, indicating faster inventory turnover driven by supply chain improvements and streamlined logistics.  <br>- DPO reduced from 46.3 to 43.8 days, suggesting better supplier negotiations or optimized payment processing despite shorter payment terms.  <br>- Cash Conversion Cycle improved from 15.3 to 13.2 days, demonstrating enhanced working capital efficiency through combined receivables, inventory, and payables management.  <br>- Operational drivers included supply chain automation investments and divestitures of international operations, allowing focus on higher-efficiency markets.

        Despite revenue growth, Walmart's profitability metrics such as net profit margin, gross profit margin, and operating profit margin have declined. Additionally, the increase in debt and decrease in cash reserves, along with higher current liabilities, suggest potential liquidity challenges. These factors are likely to negatively impact net income, leading to a decrease in earnings per share (EPS) next year.
