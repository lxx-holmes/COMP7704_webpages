        Risks:<br>- International operations face cost increases and disruptions from economic factors, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical tensions.<br>- Supplier vulnerabilities due to inflation, labor/material costs, and extreme weather may reduce inventory availability or raise prices.<br>- Strategic alliances (e.g., fintech venture ONE) may underperform expectations, harming financial results or competitive positioning.<br>- Pandemics/health crises like COVID-19 could disrupt operations, alter consumer demand, and increase fulfillment/supply chain costs.<br>- Natural disasters, climate change, and geopolitical conflicts (e.g., Red Sea shipping risks) may damage facilities or force store closures.<br><br>Opportunities:<br>- Expanding omni-channel capabilities (curbside pickup, mobile Scan & Go) to enhance customer convenience and drive sales growth.<br>- Membership programs like Sam's Club Plus (7% YoY income growth) and Sam's Cash loyalty rewards strengthen recurring revenue streams.<br>- Strategic healthcare partnerships (e.g., UnitedHealth Group) and fintech initiatives diversify revenue beyond core retail operations.<br>- Global fulfillment network optimization (3,500+ India facilities, ship-from-club capabilities) improves inventory efficiency and delivery speed.<br>- Cybersecurity investments (NIST framework alignment, threat monitoring) and cross-functional risk management protect operations and customer trust.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin increased from 1.91% (2023) to 2.39% (2024) due to reduced operating expenses from resolved opioid-related legal settlements and Walmart International segment restructuring.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin rose from 24.13% to 24.53% through improved price management, competitive pricing strategies, and reduced product markdowns.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin grew from 3.34% to 4.17% as operating expenses decreased by 60 basis points, aided by absence of prior-year legal/restructuring charges.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) improved from 4.80% to 6.15% through higher net income and more efficient asset utilization across operations.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) increased from 13.94% to 17.16%, driven by net income growth and share buybacks reducing outstanding shares.  <br>- Strategic technology investments, eCommerce expansion, and omni-channel initiatives enhanced operational efficiency and cost reductions.  <br>- Margin improvements reflect better cost control in sales, supply chain optimization, and process automation initiatives.  <br>- All profitability metrics show consistent gains from 2023 to 2024, indicating effective execution of operational improvement strategies.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved slightly from 0.82 (2023) to 0.83 (2024) due to increased cash equivalents ($9.9B vs. $8.8B) and reduced working capital deficit ($15.5B vs. $16.5B), but remains below 1, indicating liquidity constraints.  <br>- Quick ratio rose from 0.18 to 0.20 (2023-2024) supported by higher operating cash flow ($35.7B in 2024), though inventory still dominates current assets, limiting liquid asset availability.  <br>- Cash ratio increased from 0.093 to 0.11 (2023-2024) through working capital initiatives, but $3.5B of foreign-held cash isn‚Äôt fully accessible, constraining short-term liquidity coverage.  <br>- Inventory management improvements reduced stock levels but left significant assets tied to inventory, restricting cash conversion flexibility.  <br>- Accounts payable increased as Walmart extended payment terms to conserve cash, potentially straining supplier relationships.  <br>- Liquidity ratios remain below industry benchmarks despite progress, with structural challenges like inventory reliance and restricted cash reserves posing ongoing short-term financial risks.  <br>- Operating cash flow growth ($35.7B in 2024) and accrued liability reductions contributed to marginal liquidity improvements, though insufficient to fully cover $93.2B current liabilities.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio decreased slightly from 0.41 (2023) to 0.40 (2024) due to equity growth ($6.595B) from retained earnings and lower share repurchases ($2.779B vs. $9.920B in 2023), despite long-term debt rising $1.483B to $36.132B.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio improved from 10.90 to 12.64, driven by a $6.584B increase in operating income ($27.012B in 2024) outpacing a $0.263B rise in interest expense ($2.137B in 2024).  <br>- Solvency Ratio increased from 1.49 to 1.79 as total liabilities surged $37.371B (to $161.828B) from $4.967B in new long-term debt and higher lease obligations, while equity growth ($90.349B in 2024) lagged liability expansion.  <br>- Share repurchases totaled $2.779B in 2024, significantly lower than 2023's $9.920B, contributing to equity preservation.  <br>- Operating lease costs and $4.967B in fiscal 2024 debt issuances amplified total liabilities, increasing financial leverage despite improved profitability.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Walmart's Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved from 11.8 days (2023) to 8.5 days (2024), driven by inventory optimization and operational efficiency.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) decreased from 43.8 to 39.6 days due to supply chain improvements, retail inventory method (RIM), and LIFO valuation practices.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increased slightly from 9.7 to 10.3 days, possibly reflecting minor shifts in customer payment terms, but had minimal CCC impact.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) improved from 41.7 to 41.4 days, supported by intercompany financing arrangements for better supplier payment management.  <br>- Faster inventory turnover (DIO) reduced holding costs, while efficient payables (DPO) and receivables (DSO) collectively enhanced cash flow availability.  <br>- The 3.3-day CCC reduction reflects stronger working capital management, freeing liquidity for growth and operational investments.
