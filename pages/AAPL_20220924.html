        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross Margin Ratio improved from 41.8% (2021) to 43.3% (2022) due to better cost management via negotiated supplier pricing or production efficiencies.  <br>- Operating Margin increased slightly from 29.8% (2021) to 30.3% (2022), reflecting enhanced operational efficiency through reduced unnecessary spending.  <br>- Net Profit Margin declined marginally from 25.9% (2021) to 25.3% (2022), potentially due to higher taxes or increased non-operating expenses like interest charges.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) rose from 27.0% (2021) to 28.3% (2022), indicating improved asset utilization efficiency driving higher profits.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) surged from 150% (2021) to 197% (2022), likely driven by reduced equity or increased leverage from debt financing.  <br>- Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) increased from 42.0% (2021) to 50.3% (2022), reflecting efficient capital allocation from successful investments or operational improvements.  <br>- Brand loyalty and strategic pricing mitigated competitive pressures, supporting margin stability despite market challenges.  <br>- Effective supply chain management reduced component supply risks, contributing to cost efficiencies.  <br>- Expansion into higher-margin services (e.g., Apple Music, iCloud) bolstered profitability.  <br>- Tax impacts or one-time charges may have partially offset net profit margin gains despite operational improvements.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 1.07x (2021) to 0.88x (2022), quick ratio from 1.03x to 0.85x, and cash ratio from 0.28x to 0.15x, reflecting deteriorating liquidity.  <br>- Current liabilities surged 23% ($125.5B to $154B) while current assets grew marginally ($134.8B to $135.4B), driven by rising accounts payable, commercial paper, and other liabilities.  <br>- Cash reserves dropped 32% ($34.9B to $23.6B) due to share buybacks, dividends, and investments in marketable securities, weakening cash ratio despite $122B operating cash flow in 2022.  <br>- Inventory decreased 25% ($6.58B to $4.95B), partially offsetting liquidity strain but insufficient against liability growth.  <br>- Vendor non-trade receivables rose 30% ($25.2B to $32.7B), contributing to current assets but failing to counterbalance liability expansion.  <br>- Net income grew from $94.7B to $99.8B, yet cash prioritization for financing activities (e.g., $109B share repurchases) over liquidity reserves exacerbated short-term coverage challenges.  <br>- Liquidity pressures highlight need to rebalance working capital strategies, reduce short-term obligations, or retain more cash despite strong operational performance.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased from 4.56 (2021) to 5.96 (2022) due to $5.5 billion new debt issuance and $90.2 billion stock repurchases reducing equity.  <br>- Interest coverage ratio reached 357.5x in 2022, driven by operating income growth to $119,437 million (+$10.5 billion YoY) with stable interest expenses.  <br>- Debt-to-Asset ratio rose from 82.1% to 85.6% as total debt increased while assets grew marginally to $352,755 million (+0.5% YoY).  <br>- Long-term Debt-to-Total Assets decreased from 46.3% to 42% despite higher overall leverage, reflecting active debt management through long-term debt reduction to $98,959 million (-$10.1 billion YoY).  <br>- Strong operating cash flow of $122,151 million (2022) supports debt servicing capacity despite increased leverage, balancing financial risk with operational performance.  <br>- Mixed solvency trends show strategic leverage increases through debt/stock buybacks offset by improved debt structure management and income growth.

          - Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) remained stable at 26.0 days (2022) vs. 26.2 days (2021), reflecting consistent customer payment timing and effective accounts receivable management despite economic uncertainties.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) improved from 11.3 days (2021) to 8.0 days (2022) due to supply chain optimization and proactive measures to reduce inventory holding periods amid component shortages.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) increased from 94.0 days (2021) to 104.5 days (2022), strategically extending supplier payment terms to enhance cash retention and manage liquidity risks with single-source suppliers.  <br>- Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved from -56.5 days (2021) to -70.5 days (2022) by accelerating inventory-to-cash conversion and delaying supplier payments, addressing supply chain disruptions and global health-related operational risks.  <br>- Efficiency gains were driven by working capital optimization, including streamlined inventory processes, renegotiated supplier terms, and stable receivables collection, mitigating external challenges like economic volatility and supply constraints.

        The company has shown consistent growth in net sales, improved gross margins, and effective management of operating expenses, leading to increased net income and EPS.
