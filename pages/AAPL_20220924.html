          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross margin ratio increased to 43.3% (2022) from 41.8% (2021) due to improved cost management via supplier negotiations and production efficiencies.  <br>- Operating margin rose slightly to 30.3% (2022) from 29.8% (2021), reflecting enhanced operational efficiency and reduced unnecessary spending.  <br>- Net profit margin decreased to 25.3% (2022) from 25.9% (2021), likely impacted by higher taxes or increased non-operating expenses like debt interest.  <br>- ROA improved to 28.3% (2022) from 27.0% (2021), driven by better asset utilization efficiency generating higher profits.  <br>- ROE surged to 197% (2022) from 150% (2021), attributed to reduced equity or increased financial leverage through debt financing.  <br>- ROIC climbed to 50.3% (2022) from 42.0% (2021), reflecting more efficient use of invested capital from successful projects or operational improvements.  <br>- Competitive pricing pressures were mitigated by Apple's brand loyalty and premium pricing strategies, supporting margin stability.  <br>- Effective supply chain management minimized component shortages and cost risks, contributing to gross margin expansion.  <br>- Growth in higher-margin services (e.g., Apple Music, iCloud) boosted overall profitability despite hardware market saturation.  <br>- Tax rate increases or one-time non-operating charges may explain the dip in net profit margin despite operational gains.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 1.07x (2021) to 0.88x (2022) due to current liabilities rising 23% ($125,481M to $153,982M) outpacing current assets' marginal 0.4% growth ($134,836M to $135,405M).  <br>- Quick ratio fell from 1.03x to 0.85x as cash/cash equivalents dropped 32% ($34,940M to $23,646M) from share repurchases, dividends, and securities investments.  <br>- Cash ratio decreased sharply from 0.28x to 0.15x, reflecting reduced capacity to meet sudden obligations with cash reserves.  <br>- Inventory levels declined 25% ($6,580M to $4,946M), partially offsetting liquidity pressures but insufficient against liability growth.  <br>- Vendor non-trade receivables increased 30% ($25,228M to $32,748M), contributing to current assets but not counterbalancing $28.5B liability surge.  <br>- Despite 5% net income growth ($94,680M to $99,803M) and $122B operating cash flow, funds were prioritized for financing activities over liquidity preservation.  <br>- Liquidity erosion reflects strategic allocation of cash to shareholder returns rather than short-term asset accumulation, despite strong operational performance.  <br>- Key liability drivers included accounts payable, commercial paper, and other current liabilities, which collectively reduced coverage ratios below 1.0x.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased from 4.56 (2021) to 5.96 (2022) due to $5.5B new term debt issuance and $90.2B share repurchases reducing equity, signaling higher leverage.  <br>- Interest coverage ratio reached 357.5 times in 2022 driven by operating income growth to $119,437M (vs $108,949M in 2021) with stable interest expenses.  <br>- Debt-to-Asset ratio rose from 82.1% to 85.6% as total debt increased while assets grew modestly to $352,755M (2022) from $351,002M (2021).  <br>- Long-term Debt-to-Total Assets declined from 46.3% to 42% despite higher overall debt, reflecting active debt structure management via long-term debt reduction to $98,959M (2022) from $109,106M (2021).  <br>- Mixed solvency trends: Increased leverage from strategic debt/stock actions offset by 42% reduction in long-term debt burden and $122,151M operating cash flow supporting debt obligations.  <br>- Strong 2022 operating performance and cash flow generation ($122B) provide flexibility to manage capital structure despite elevated financial risk from higher leverage.

          - Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) remained stable at 26.0 days (2022) vs. 26.2 days (2021), indicating consistent customer payment timing through effective accounts receivable management despite economic uncertainties.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) improved significantly from 11.3 days (2021) to 8.0 days (2022) due to supply chain optimization and reduced inventory holding periods amid component shortage risks.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) increased from 94.0 days (2021) to 104.5 days (2022), reflecting strategic extension of supplier payment terms to enhance cash retention and negotiate favorable terms.  <br>- Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved from -56.5 days (2021) to -70.5 days (2022), driven by faster inventory turnover and extended payables, optimizing working capital management during supply chain disruptions.  <br>- Inventory management improvements align with efforts to mitigate risks from single-source supplier dependencies and global operational challenges.  <br>- Stable DSO performance contrasts with external risks like economic volatility, demonstrating resilient cash inflow management.  <br>- The negative CCC progression highlights Apple‚Äôs ability to generate cash faster than obligations mature, strengthening liquidity amid operational uncertainties.

        The company has shown consistent growth in net sales, improved gross margins, and effective management of operating expenses, leading to increased net income and EPS.
