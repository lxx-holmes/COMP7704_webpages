        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio decreased from 0.988 (2023) to 0.867 (2024) due to current liabilities rising $31,084M (vs. current asset growth of $9,421M), reducing short-term liability coverage capacity.  <br>- Quick ratio declined from 0.945 to 0.826 as liquid assets (excluding inventory) became insufficient relative to growing obligations.  <br>- Cash ratio fell from 0.206 to 0.170 with $794M net cash decrease in 2024, exacerbated by $94,949M share repurchases and $15,234M dividend payments.  <br>- Operating liabilities increased significantly: accounts payable rose $6,020M and other current liabilities grew $15,552M, straining liquidity.  <br>- $53B manufacturing purchase obligations and $12B other commitments contributed to 21.4% current liability growth, outpacing 6.6% current asset expansion.  <br>- Cash reserves diminished despite $5,760M net increase in 2023, as 2024 saw accelerated capital return programs and operational spending.  <br>- Reduced financial flexibility raises concerns about meeting unexpected obligations, with all liquidity metrics signaling tighter working capital management needs.  <br>- Lease obligations and supplier commitments amplified pressure on quick assets, highlighting potential risks in maintaining strategic investment capacity.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio rose from 4.68 (2023) to 5.41 (2024) due to increased total liabilities ($308,030M vs $290,437M) from new debt issuances and reduced equity ($56,950M vs $62,146M) from $95B share buybacks.  <br>- Financial Leverage ratio increased from 82.4% to 84.4% as liabilities grew faster than assets ($364,980M in 2024 vs $352,583M in 2023), driven by debt-funded asset investments in property, equipment, and inventories.  <br>- Total liabilities rose $17.6B year-over-year, including $53B in manufacturing purchase obligations (mostly short-term), amplifying short-term debt exposure.  <br>- Shareholders‚Äô equity declined $5.2B due to share repurchases outweighing retained earnings, exacerbating debt reliance.  <br>- A $10.2B one-time tax charge reduced cash reserves, likely contributing to increased debt financing needs.  <br>- Higher leverage ratios reflect intensified debt dependence, elevating financial risk despite maintained solvency.

          - Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increased from 28.0 days (2023) to 31.14 days (2024), reflecting slower collections likely due to economic pressures affecting consumer spending and credit conditions.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) rose from 10.8 days (2023) to 12.6 days (2024), suggesting slower inventory turnover from reduced demand or overstocking risks.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) increased significantly from 106.7 days (2023) to 119.6 days (2024), indicating strategic supplier payment term extensions to improve cash flow.  <br>- Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved from -67.9 days (2023) to -76.86 days (2024), driven by extended DPO, allowing Apple to collect customer payments before settling supplier obligations.  <br>- Economic risks noted in financial statements (e.g., regional sales declines, macroeconomic instability) contextualize slower collections and inventory challenges.  <br>- Cash flow statements show increased operating cash generation, supporting the effectiveness of extended payables as a liquidity management strategy.  <br>- Segment data reveals minor net sales declines in some regions, potentially contributing to inventory turnover delays and receivables collection slowdowns.

        Despite a slight decrease in net income this year due to higher taxes, Apple's improved gross and operating margins, efficient cash management, and ongoing share buybacks are expected to drive an increase in earnings per share next year. Continued investment in high-margin services and potential new products from R&D efforts should further support EPS growth.
