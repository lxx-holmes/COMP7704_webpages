        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin decreased slightly from 20.53% (2021) to 20.37% (2022) due to SG&A expenses rising 24% ($12,349M to $15,260M) and R&D costs increasing, outpacing 3% revenue growth.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin declined from 31.91% to 31.18% as total operating costs rose $1,664M (driven by SG&A/R&D), offsetting modest revenue growth.  <br>- ROA improved from 7.87% to 8.53% despite a $7,724M asset reduction, reflecting $296M net earnings increase ($11,549M to $11,845M) and better asset utilization.  <br>- ROE dropped from 74.7% to 68.5% as equity decreased $1,911M ($64,129M to $62,218M) without proportional net income growth, despite higher earnings.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin rose from 68.9% to 69.9% with flat cost of products sold ($17,446M to $17,414M) against 3% revenue growth, indicating production efficiency gains.  <br>- $766M acquisition/restructuring costs in 2022 contributed to operating expense increases, directly impacting profit margins.  <br>- Russia-Ukraine conflict led to suspended aesthetic product sales in Russia, while COVID-19 reduced global new patient starts, affecting revenue streams.  <br>- Strategic R&D investments increased expenses ($6,922M to $6,510M) but aimed to strengthen long-term growth through pipeline development and brand support.  <br>- Margin pressures emerged from rising operational costs and equity structure changes, partially offset by asset optimization and cost containment in production.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved from 0.794 (2021) to 0.965 (2022), driven by a $5.7B reduction in current liabilities (from $35,194M to $29,538M) and stable current assets ($27,928M to $28,463M).  <br>- Quick ratio rose from 0.705 to 0.843, reflecting enhanced liquidity coverage of liabilities through reduced obligations and stable liquid asset levels.  <br>- Cash ratio increased modestly from 0.280 to 0.313, supported by operating cash flow growth to $24,943M (2022 vs. $22,777M in 2021).  <br>- Liquidity improvement resulted primarily from aggressive current liability management, including potential debt repayment/accounts payable reductions, while maintaining working capital stability.  <br>- Operating cash flow generation (+$2.2B YoY) directly strengthened cash reserves and supported short-term obligation coverage capabilities.  <br>- Efficient working capital management is evident through simultaneous liability reduction (-16% current liabilities) and near-flat current assets (+1.9% YoY).

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - AbbVie's Debt-to-Equity ratio decreased from 8.49 (2021) to 7.03 (2022) due to $14.4 billion in long-term debt repayments and increased equity from higher net earnings.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio improved from 7.52 to 8.86, driven by increased operating earnings from revenue growth (5.3% YoY) and cost management initiatives.  <br>- Financial Leverage Ratio declined from 9.49 to 8.03, supported by $24.9 billion in operational cash flow used for debt reduction and strategic investments.  <br>- Management strengthened the balance sheet through Allergan acquisition integration, capital structure optimization, and handling contingent liabilities.  <br>- Despite solvency improvements, elevated debt-to-equity levels (7.03 in 2022) indicate residual financial risk during economic downturns.  <br>- Strategic debt repayment and operational cash flow prioritization reduced total debt by 18% while maintaining business investment capacity.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO increased from 64.8 days (2021) to 70.7 days (2022), indicating slower receivables collection due to extended customer payment terms or reduced collection efficiency, mitigated by non-significant factoring arrangements.  <br>- DIO rose from 65.5 days (2021) to 75 days (2022), reflecting slower inventory turnover from strategic stockpiling, supply chain adjustments, or reduced sales velocity.  <br>- DPO increased from 473.6 days (2021) to 532.7 days (2022), driven by extended supplier payment terms to retain cash, supported by strong credit facilities and ratings.  <br>- CCC became more negative (-387 days in 2022 vs. -343.3 days in 2021), showing improved efficiency as supplier credit funds operations longer than inventory/receivables cycles.  <br>- Strategic working capital management prioritized optimizing cash flow via extended payables, monitored receivables, and inventory adjustments, enhancing operational funding flexibility.  <br>- Overall financial health strengthened by access to capital, creditworthiness, and balancing longer supplier terms with manageable receivables/inventory delays.

        Based on the analysis of AbbVie's financial statements, the company has shown steady revenue growth, improved liquidity and solvency ratios, and efficient working capital management. Despite slight decreases in certain profitability margins, the overall positive trends suggest that earnings per share (EPS) are likely to increase next year, supported by continued revenue growth and effective expense management.
