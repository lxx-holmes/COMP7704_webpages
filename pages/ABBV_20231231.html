        **Risks:**  <br>- Loss of exclusivity for Humira (27% of 2023 revenue) due to biosimilar competition in the U.S., driving significant revenue decline.  <br>- Patent challenges and litigation risks could accelerate generic/biosimilar competition, eroding market exclusivity for key products.  <br>- R&D failures or delays in pipeline development (90+ compounds in progress) may impair growth and revenue replacement efforts.  <br>- International operations face currency fluctuations, pricing restrictions, and regulatory uncertainties, impacting 23% of total revenue.  <br>- Dependence on three U.S. wholesale distributors (McKesson, Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen) creates supply chain concentration risk.  <br><br>**Opportunities:**  <br>- Expansion of immunology portfolio (Skyrizi, Rinvoq) into new indications like ulcerative colitis and Crohn‚Äôs disease.  <br>- Acquisitions (e.g., ImmunoGen, Cerevel Therapeutics) to strengthen oncology, neuroscience pipelines and ADC/neurodegenerative therapy capabilities.  <br>- Strategic collaborations/licensing (e.g., Syndesi, DJS Antibodies) to enhance R&D in fibrosis, immunology, and rare diseases.  <br>- Growth in emerging markets through diversified geographic commercialization and localized healthcare partnerships.  <br>- Strong operating cash flow ($22.8B in 2023) supports dividends, share repurchases, and strategic M&A to sustain long-term growth.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio rose from 7.03 (2022) to 11.95 (2023), driven by reduced equity and increased leverage, amplifying financial risk despite long-term debt decreasing from $59,135M to $52,194M.  <br>- Total equity dropped from $17,287M to $10,397M due to lower net earnings ($11,845M to $4,873M), $10.5B in dividends, and $1.97B in treasury stock buybacks.  <br>- Solvency ratio (total liabilities/equity) worsened to 11.95 (2023 vs. 7.03 in 2022), reflecting heightened debt reliance despite a $6.9B reduction in long-term debt.  <br>- Interest coverage ratio declined from 8.86 to 7.57, linked to lower earnings reducing capacity to cover interest expenses, though coverage remains healthy.  <br>- Current portion of long-term debt increased, indicating higher near-term obligations, while equity erosion from shareholder payouts and earnings decline disproportionately impacted leverage metrics.  <br>- Financial risk escalated in 2023 primarily due to equity depletion outweighing debt reduction efforts, despite maintaining adequate interest coverage.

        Based on the financial analysis, AbbVie's earnings per share (EPS) are expected to decrease next year. The significant decline in net earnings, operating margins, and profitability metrics, coupled with increased costs and higher leverage, indicate ongoing challenges. While R&D investments are positive, the current negative trends in profitability and equity erosion suggest that EPS will likely decrease in the coming year.
