          - DSO increased from 53 days (2021) to 55 days (2022), likely due to complex client contracts and revenue growth across segments slowing collections.  <br>- DIO remained 0 days both years, reflecting Accenture's service-based model with minimal inventory holdings.  <br>- DPO rose from 56 days (2021) to 58 days (2022), indicating strategic supplier payment term extensions to optimize cash flow.  <br>- CCC stayed at -3 days both years, showing efficient cash management despite DSO/DPO changes, with receivables collected faster than payables.  <br>- Revenue growth (+13% YoY) and multi-obligation contracts contributed to DSO increase, as noted in segment performance disclosures.  <br>- Strong cash reserves ($6.5 billion in 2022) support extended DPO strategy and negative CCC maintenance.  <br>- Lease obligation management (Note 8) aligns with broader financial discipline in payable terms.  <br>- Monitoring needed for DSO/DPO trends to prevent future cash management risks despite current efficiency.
