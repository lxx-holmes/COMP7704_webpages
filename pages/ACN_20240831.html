          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined to 1.10 (2024) from 1.30 (2023) due to lower current assets ($20.86M vs. $23.38M) and higher current liabilities ($18.98M vs. $18.01M).  <br>- Quick ratio fell to 0.98 (2024) from 1.18 (2023) as cash reserves dropped 45% ($5.00M vs. $9.05M) and accounts receivable decreased by $1.44M.  <br>- Cash ratio halved to 0.26 (2024) from 0.50 (2023) with cash/cash equivalents decreasing $4.04M and liabilities rising $0.97M.  <br>- $6.58M spent on business investments in 2024 (vs. $2.53M in 2023) and $4.52M on share buybacks (up from $4.33M) reduced liquid assets.  <br>- Dividend payments increased to $3.24M (from $2.83M), while operating cash flow slightly declined to $9.13M (from $9.52M).  <br>- Rising remaining performance obligations created future revenue commitments but did not provide immediate liquidity relief.

          - Debt-to-Equity ratio decreased from 0.966 (2023) to 0.946 (2024), reflecting reduced leverage due to increased equity from $4.524B share buybacks in 2024 (up from $4.330B in 2023).  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio declined from 192.5 to 164.5 but remains strong, supported by rising operating income despite higher interest expenses ($37,182 paid in 2024).  <br>- Solvency Ratio (Total Liabilities/Equity) improved slightly (0.946 in 2024 vs. 0.966 in 2023) as equity growth from buybacks and retained earnings outpaced liabilities.  <br>- Total liabilities and equity both increased, with equity rising more significantly due to strategic share repurchases and retained earnings.  <br>- Operating cash flows remained robust at $9.131B in 2024, enabling $6.582B in acquisitions and aggressive buybacks despite slightly lower liquidity.  <br>- Strategic investments in acquisitions and equity growth initiatives highlight a focus on long-term financial health, balancing debt management with expansion.

          - Accenture's Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) increased from 48.6 days in 2023 to 51 days in 2024, driven by a rise in Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) from 69.6 to 72.8 days, indicating slower customer payment collections.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) remained stable (21.0 days in 2023 vs. 21.8 days in 2024), reflecting consistent supplier payment terms and effective cash flow management.  <br>- Higher DSO in 2024 was linked to slower collections, extended client payment terms (notably in Health & Public Service sectors with significant revenue growth), and a $601,935 decrease in receivables/contract assets, signaling increased outstanding payments.  <br>- Economic slowdowns may have contributed to delayed customer payments, exacerbating DSO challenges and lengthening the CCC.  <br>- While CCC efficiency declined slightly in 2024, stable DPO highlights maintained supplier relationships, with the primary improvement opportunity lying in enhanced accounts receivable management to accelerate cash conversion.

        Accenture has demonstrated consistent revenue growth, improved expense management, and increased net income. The company's ability to manage costs effectively, coupled with a rise in shareholders' equity and potential share buybacks, supports the expectation of higher earnings per share next year. Despite some concerns regarding liquidity and a slight decline in return metrics, the overall positive trends in profitability and equity management suggest an increase in EPS.
