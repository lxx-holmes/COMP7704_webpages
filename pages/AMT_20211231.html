          - Net profit margin increased from 21.02% (2020) to 27.47% (2021) due to improved revenue recognition (straight-line lease accounting) and effective cost management despite revenue growth  <br>- ROA improved slightly from 3.58% to 3.67% through more efficient asset utilization supported by rigorous valuation methods (replacement costs, discounted cash flows) and asset lifecycle management  <br>- ROE decreased from 37.04% to 28.3% as equity base expanded faster than net income growth, driven by investments in data center assets and retained earnings  <br>- Gross profit margin remained strong despite slight decline (72.3% to 71.35%), reflecting minor COGS increases offset by maintained pricing power and cost control  <br>- Operating profit margin fell from 35.88% to 33.46% due to operating expense growth outpacing revenue, linked to capital expenditures and infrastructure expansion costs  <br>- High gross margin (71.35% in 2021) underscores sustained pricing strategy effectiveness and operational cost discipline across periods  <br>- Revenue recognition policies (particularly straight-line lease revenue accounting) directly contributed to improved net earnings and margin expansion  <br>- Increased equity base from property investments and retained earnings diluted ROE despite improved absolute profitability metrics

          - Current ratio decreased from 0.80 (2020) to 0.41 (2021), reflecting $0.41 of current assets per $1 of liabilities, driven by current liabilities rising from $789.8M to $4,568.7M.  <br>- Quick ratio declined from 0.76 to 0.37, with liquid assets (cash $1,949.9M, receivables $728.9M, securities $657.2M) covering only $0.37 per $1 of liabilities in 2021.  <br>- Cash ratio dropped from 0.478 to 0.215 due to reduced cash reserves from InSite Debt repayment and disproportionate liability growth.  <br>- Current portion of long-term obligations surged 479% ($789.8M to $4,568.7M), outpacing current asset growth and straining liquidity.  <br>- Short-term liquidity weakened significantly, indicating challenges in meeting obligations and requiring improved cash reserves, liability management, and operational cash flow.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio decreased from 9.3 (2020) to 6.7 (2021) due to debt repayment (e.g., CoreSite/InSite Debt) and equity growth ($4,568.4M to $9,069.6M) via retained earnings and foreign currency adjustments.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio improved from 2.3x (2020) to 3.25x (2021) as EBIT grew 55% ($1,821.1M to $2,829.4M), outpacing interest expense increases ($793.5M to $870.9M).  <br>- Times Interest Earned ratio rose from 2.8x (2020) to 4.0x (2021) due to higher EBIT and stabilized interest expenses from debt restructuring and interest rate swaps (Note 50).  <br>- Debt repayment included $1.1B CoreSite senior unsecured notes and InSite Debt using credit facilities and cash reserves, reducing total liabilities ($60,818.3M in 2021 vs. $42,453.0M in 2020).  <br>- Equity doubled from $4,568.4M (2020) to $9,069.6M (2021), driven by retained earnings and operational performance, strengthening the capital structure.  <br>- Interest rate swaps and proactive debt management hedged against rate volatility, contributing to solvency stability despite rising interest costs.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO increased from 23.2 days (2020) to 28.4 days (2021), driven by accounts receivable growth ($511.6M to $728.9M), revenue mix shift toward services (non-lease revenue up $87.9M to $247.3M), and foreign currency losses of $466.5M affecting international collections.  <br>- DPO rose from 22.8 days (2020) to 37.1 days (2021) due to accounts payable growth ($139.1M to $272.4M) and improved cash reserves ($1,746.3M to $1,949.9M unrestricted cash), enabling extended supplier payment terms.  <br>- Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased from $1,861.4M (2020) to $2,343.3M (2021), supporting liquidity despite slower receivables collection.  <br>- CCC calculation remains incomplete due to missing DIO data, suggesting inventory impact is minimal or classified differently.  <br>- Total operating revenue grew by $1.3B, driven by property leases and services expansion, increasing working capital management complexity.  <br>- Foreign exchange volatility and service revenue terms (vs. lease revenue) contributed to extended collection cycles and cash flow challenges.
