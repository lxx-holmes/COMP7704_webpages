          - Depreciation, amortization, and accretion increased to 31.3% of revenue (up 6.36 percentage points) alongside total operating expenses rising to 78.0% (up 11.45 percentage points), driving operating income down 11.52 percentage points to 21.96%.  <br>- Income from continuing operations before taxes fell 14.20 percentage points to 16.05% of revenue, with net income declining 11.62 percentage points to 15.82% of revenue.  <br>- Basic EPS dropped 32.6% to $3.83, and diluted EPS decreased 32.5% to $3.82, reflecting reduced profitability.  <br>- Total revenue grew 14.6% year-over-year to $10,711.1 million, but gross profit and income from operations both fell 24.9% to $2,352.3 million.  <br>- Net income declined 33.8% year-over-year to $1,696.7 million.  <br>- Total liabilities decreased to 81.62% of total assets/liabilities & equity (down 5.38 percentage points), while equity rose to 18.46% (up 5.49 percentage points).  <br>- Year-over-year liabilities decreased 9.91%, and shareholders' equity surged 36.80%.  <br>- Income tax provision increased 2.576 percentage points to -0.224% of revenue.  <br>- Net income attributable to common stockholders declined 10.97 percentage points to 16.48% of revenue.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin declined from 27.45% (2021) to 16.48% (2022) due to increased operating expenses (rising from $6,224.9M to $8,358.8M) and $655.9M impairment charges, outpacing revenue growth.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin dropped from 33.48% to 21.97%, driven by higher SG&A expenses ($811.6M to $972.3M) and depreciation/amortization costs ($2,332.6M to $3,355.1M).  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) fell from 3.67% to 2.63%, reflecting reduced asset efficiency as expense growth eroded net income.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) decreased sharply from 28.30% to 14.23%, signaling lower returns for shareholders amid rising costs.  <br>- Profitability declines were exacerbated by revenue growth being outpaced by operating expense increases, SG&A expansion, and non-cash impairment charges.  <br>- All key ratios (margins, ROA, ROE) showed deterioration, highlighting systemic challenges in cost management and operational efficiency.

          - Current ratio improved from 0.411 (2021) to 0.436 (2022) as current liabilities decreased from $9,067.3M to $8,311.9M, partially from debt repayment, but remains below 1, signaling insufficient short-term asset coverage.  <br>- Quick ratio increased from 0.295 to 0.335, driven by cash growth ($1,949.9M to $2,028.4M) and receivables increase ($728.9M to $758.3M), yet under 1 indicates reliance on non-inventory assets remains limited.  <br>- Cash ratio rose from 0.215 to 0.244 due to $78.5M cash increase, but low ratio highlights ongoing dependence on non-cash assets to meet obligations.  <br>- Reduced current liabilities by $755.4M (2021-2022) and strategic debt repayments (e.g., U.S. Subsidiary Debt) enhanced all liquidity ratios.  <br>- Working capital management improvements noted in financial reports contributed to slight liquidity gains despite persistent sub-1 ratios.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio improved from 6.70 (2021) to 4.42 (2022) due to debt repayment (e.g., $962.9 million CoreSite Debt, U.S. Subsidiary Debt, Kenya Debt) and $2.3 billion equity issuance via common stock offering, strengthening the equity position.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio declined from 3.60 (2021) to 2.07 (2022) as rising interest rates (e.g., variable-rate debt weighted-average rate at 4.71% in 2022) increased expenses, outpacing operating earnings growth.  <br>- Times Interest Earned Ratio mirrored the Interest Coverage Ratio decline, reflecting reduced earnings capacity relative to interest obligations due to higher variable-rate debt costs.  <br>- Equity growth was driven by strategic capital allocation, including debt repayment and equity issuance, enhancing financial stability despite increased leverage risks.  <br>- Debt restructuring (e.g., 3.650% and 4.050% senior unsecured notes) optimized capital structure but exposed the company to elevated financial risk from interest expense pressures.

          - DSO decreased from 28.4 days (2021) to 25.8 days (2022), reflecting faster receivables collection and improved liquidity, supported by increased cash reserves ($1,949.9M to $2,028.4M).  <br>- DPO dropped sharply from 37.1 days (2021) to 24.4 days (2022), indicating quicker supplier payments potentially due to negotiated terms or early payment discounts.  <br>- CCC shifted from -8.7 days (2021) to 1.4 days (2022), showing a transition from paying suppliers faster than collecting receivables to a slight alignment favoring receivables, while maintaining efficient cash management.  <br>- Lower DSO reduces working capital needs and enhances liquidity, while reduced DPO optimizes cash usage but risks supplier relationship strain.  <br>- The CCC improvement reflects strategic cash management evolution, balancing receivables/payables dynamics despite tighter cash flow conditions.  <br>- Negative CCC in 2021 highlighted exceptional working capital efficiency, whereas 2022's positive CCC signals adjusted but still effective operational timing.  <br>- Changes are driven by enhanced collection practices, cash reserve growth, and payment term optimization, aligning with AMT's working capital prioritization.

        The analysis of American Tower Corporation's financial statements indicates a concerning trend of decreasing profitability. Despite increasing revenues, operating expenses have grown faster, leading to a decline in operating income and net income. The earnings per share (EPS) have also shown a significant decrease, particularly from 2021 to 2022. Profitability margins have weakened, and although the company's equity position has improved, the ability to cover interest expenses has diminished. These factors suggest that without significant cost reductions or revenue growth, EPS is likely to decrease next year.
