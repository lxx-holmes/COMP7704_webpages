        Risks:  <br>- High long-term debt obligations with $50.6 billion outstanding, exposing liquidity to interest rate fluctuations and refinancing risks.  <br>- Significant lease liabilities ($82.1 billion present value) create long-term cash flow commitments amid operational scalability challenges.  <br>- Regulatory scrutiny on antitrust, data privacy, and tax practices risks fines, operational changes, and reputational damage.  <br>- Stock-based compensation expenses ($12.8 billion in 2021) and $16.6 billion unrecognized costs may pressure future earnings and dilute shareholders.  <br>- Dependence on third-party shipping/logistics partners exposes operations to labor shortages, cost inflation, and supply chain disruptions.  <br><br>Opportunities:  <br>- Low-interest debt issuance (e.g., 0.25% notes due 2023) optimizes capital structure and funds growth initiatives like AWS expansion.  <br>- Strategic equity investments (e.g., $15.6 billion in Rivian) position Amazon in high-growth sectors like electric vehicles and sustainability.  <br>- Extended useful lives of servers/networking equipment reduce depreciation, boosting 2022 operating income by $3.1 billion.  <br>- Tax benefits from accelerated depreciation and stock-based deductions lower effective tax rates, enhancing cash flow.  <br>- Expanding fulfillment/data center infrastructure via leases supports e-commerce and AWS scalability, driving market dominance.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin increased from 5.5% (2020) to 7.1% (2021) due to improved cost management and inventory efficiency, supported by better product selection and operating expense control.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin declined from 5.9% (2020) to 5.3% (2021) driven by higher fulfillment costs, wage increases, and expansion investments in new geographies/product lines.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) rose from 6.6% (2020) to 7.9% (2021) reflecting enhanced asset efficiency through technology investments (e.g., AWS) and process/customer experience improvements.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) improved from 22.8% (2020) to 24.1% (2021) due to effective equity use via restricted stock units (RSUs) aligning employee/shareholder interests and higher net income.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin grew from 39.7% (2020) to 42.0% (2021) from better cost controls in sales, inventory availability optimization, and reduced waste.  <br>- Asset Turnover decreased from 1.20 (2020) to 1.12 (2021) as asset base expanded faster than sales growth due to fulfillment network growth and technology infrastructure investments.  <br>- Profitability gains (net margin, ROA, ROE, gross margin) highlight improved cost management and operational efficiency despite higher operating expenses from strategic expansion efforts.  <br>- Declining asset turnover and operating margin reflect short-term trade-offs from growth initiatives like fulfillment network expansion and geographic/product line diversification.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current Ratio improved from 1.05x (2020) to 1.14x (2021) due to current assets growth (32% increase) outpacing liabilities (13% increase), driven by marketable securities (+41%) and accounts receivable (+34%).  <br>- Quick Ratio rose from 0.86x to 0.91x, reflecting increased liquid assets (marketable securities +$17.6B, receivables +$8.3B) offsetting inventory growth (+37%).  <br>- Cash Ratio marginally improved from 0.67x to 0.68x, remaining below 1 as cash reserves declined (-14%) and reliance on non-cash assets (marketable securities +$59.8B) persisted.  <br>- Total current assets grew $28.8B (2020-2021), while current liabilities rose $15.9B, enhancing short-term liquidity despite $5.9B cash reduction.  <br>- Long-term debt increased 53% ($31.8B to $48.7B), with new debt issuances (e.g., 0.250% Notes due 2023) impacting cash flow and interest expenses (+20%).  <br>- Property/equipment investments surged 42% ($113.1B to $160.3B), diverting cash into infrastructure and finance leases ($7.1B in 2021).  <br>- Operating leases rose 49% ($37.6B to $56.1B), conserving cash for operations but increasing lease liabilities (+$15.1B).  <br>- Net cash from operations jumped 56% ($21.3B to $33.4B), supporting liquidity despite $25.4B used in investing activities (marketable securities +$17.6B).  <br>- Accounts receivable growth (+34%) and inventory buildup (+37%) reflected expanded customer base and supply chain investments, partially offsetting liquidity strain.  <br>- Comprehensive income declined due to foreign currency adjustments (-$819M) and unrealized securities losses (-$377M), though net income rose 56% ($21.3B to $33.4B).  <br>- Stockholders' equity increased 48% ($93.4B to $138.2B) from retained earnings and stock compensation (+38% to $12.7B), bolstering financial flexibility.  <br>- Revenue growth (+24% to $478.7B) and operating cash flow strength offset rising operating expenses (+22% to $445.6B) and tax payments (+116% to $5.9B).  <br>- Restricted cash increased slightly ($233M to $242M) for obligations, while marketable securities ($59.8B) provided near-cash liquidity buffers.  <br>- Despite improved ratios, cash reserves remained below optimal levels (Cash Ratio <1), signaling reliance on non-cash assets for short-term obligations.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio improved from 2.44 (2020) to 2.04 (2021) due to stockholders' equity growth ($93.4B to $138.2B) outpacing long-term debt increases ($31.8B to $48.7B), driven by retained earnings ($52.6B to $85.9B) and stock-based compensation.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio remained strong at 13.75 (2021 vs. 13.9 in 2020) as EBIT growth from higher net income ($21.3B to $33.4B) offset increased interest expenses ($916M to $1.1B).  <br>- Solvency Ratio (Total Liabilities/Equity) improved from 2.44 to 2.04, reflecting equity growth exceeding liabilities ($227.8B to $282.3B) through retained earnings and $12.7B in 2021 stock-based compensation.  <br>- $18.5B in new debt issued in 2021 included $1.0B allocated to green/social projects, aligning with strategic initiatives.  <br>- Stockholders' equity expanded via additional paid-in capital ($42.9B to $55.5B) and retained earnings, supported by $12.7B in employee stock issuances and compensation.  <br>- Total liabilities grew at a slower rate than equity (24% vs. 48% equity growth), enhancing long-term financial stability.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO increased from 23.18 days (2020) to 25.48 days (2021), indicating slower customer payments due to economic conditions, customer behavior, and higher accounts receivable.  <br>- DIO rose from 37.23 days to 43.73 days, reflecting overstocking or slower sales from supply chain disruptions/demand shifts, supported by increased inventory levels.  <br>- DPO decreased from 113.42 days to 105.52 days, showing faster supplier payments due to efficient cash management and optimized payable terms per financial statements.  <br>- CCC became less negative (-53.01 days to -36.41 days), signaling tighter working capital management with cash tied longer in inventory/receivables as both increased.  <br>- Recommendations include reducing DIO/DSO for cash flow efficiency and monitoring inventory to align with demand and prevent excess stock.
