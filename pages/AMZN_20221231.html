        Risks:  <br>- Data breaches and security vulnerabilities could lead to litigation, regulatory action, and reputational harm despite existing protective measures.  <br>- System interruptions due to disasters, cyberattacks, or operational failures may disrupt services, reduce sales, and strain recovery resources.  <br>- Dependence on key personnel and intense competition for skilled labor could impair operations if retention or recruitment efforts fail.  <br>- Reliance on limited suppliers and single-source providers risks supply chain disruptions, delays, and compliance-related liabilities.  <br>- Acquisitions and investments may fail to integrate successfully, causing financial losses, operational strain, or asset impairment.  <br><br>Opportunities:  <br>- Growth in service sales (e.g., AWS, advertising) demonstrates expanding high-margin revenue streams and market leadership.  <br>- Strong liquidity ($53.9B cash and equivalents in 2022) supports investments in innovation, infrastructure, and strategic acquisitions.  <br>- Strategic alliances and commercial agreements (e.g., cloud services) enhance ecosystem stickiness and diversified revenue opportunities.  <br>- International expansion offers untapped markets, though requiring localized adaptation and regulatory navigation.  <br>- Investments in technology, content, and infrastructure (e.g., $20.3B goodwill in 2022) position the company for long-term scalability.

          - Other Income (Expense), Net decreased 6.38% of total revenue (3.11% in 2021 to -3.27% in 2022), contributing to a 7.63% decline in Net Income margin (7.10% to -0.53%).  <br>- Gross Profit grew 14.52% YoY ($197,478 to $225,152), but Income from Operations fell 50.73% ($24,879 to $12,248) and Net Income plummeted 91.83% ($33,364 to -$2,722).  <br>- Marketable securities declined sharply from 14.2% to 3.5% of total assets (-10.7% shift), while total current assets decreased from 38.4% to 31.7% (-6.7% shift).  <br>- Total Assets grew 10.02% YoY ($420,549 to $462,675), outpaced by Total Liabilities growth of 12.17% ($282,304 to $316,632).  <br>- Shareholders' Equity increased 5.64% YoY ($138,245 to $146,043), reflecting slower growth compared to liabilities.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin declined from 7.1% (2021) to -0.5% (2022) due to increased operating expenses, $1.1B impairments in physical stores, and contract termination/severance costs.  <br>- Operating profit margin decreased from 5.3% to 2.4%, driven by rising fulfillment costs (higher wages, infrastructure), technology investments, and marketing expenses.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) fell from 8.0% to -0.6%, reflecting inefficient asset utilization and impairments impacting profitability despite higher sales.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) dropped from 24.1% to -1.9% as net income turned negative, significantly reducing shareholder returns.  <br>- Gross profit margin improved slightly from 42.0% to 43.8%, but higher cost of sales ($288.8B in 2022 vs. $272.3B in 2021) limited overall profitability gains.  <br>- Key drivers included $1.1B in property/equipment impairments, increased fulfillment and tech costs (payroll, infrastructure), and higher cost of sales outpacing revenue growth.  <br>- Foreign exchange fluctuations contributed marginally to expense increases but were secondary to operational cost pressures.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 1.14 (2021) to 0.94 (2022) due to reduced current assets ($161.6B to $146.8B) and higher current liabilities ($142.3B to $155.4B), driven by lower marketable securities and increased payables.  <br>- Quick ratio fell from 0.91 to 0.72 as marketable securities plummeted $59.8B to $16.1B, outweighing cash/cash equivalents growth, reflecting weaker liquidity excluding inventories.  <br>- Cash ratio improved from 0.25 to 0.35 due to higher cash reserves, but overall liquidity remained constrained by rising liabilities and asset declines.  <br>- Net income dropped from $33.4B profit to $2.7B loss in 2022, impacted by $13.4B impairment losses and $2.1B severance costs, reducing operational cash flow.  <br>- Current liabilities increased 9.2% to $155.4B, primarily from higher accounts payable and accrued expenses, intensifying short-term obligations.  <br>- Operating cash flow weakened despite remaining positive, with significant $61.7B invested in property/equipment and debt activity shifts, prioritizing long-term growth over short-term liquidity.  <br>- Marketable securities reduction ($59.8B to $16.1B) was the largest contributor to declining current assets, partially offset by cash/cash equivalents growth.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased from 2.04x (2021) to 2.17x (2022) due to $12.8B and $8.3B debt issuances in April/December 2022, raising long-term debt from $48.7B to $67.2B, while equity only grew modestly from $138.2B to $146.0B.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio fell sharply from 13.75x to 5.17x as EBIT dropped 51% ($24.9B to $12.2B) and interest expense rose 31% ($1.8B to $2.4B), driven by higher operating costs and $2.6B impairment/severance expenses.  <br>- Solvency Ratio worsened from 2.04x to 2.17x with liabilities growing faster (+12%) than equity (+6%), as total liabilities increased from $282.3B to $316.6B.  <br>- Increased leverage reflects $63.6B in 2022 property/equipment investments and $8.3B acquisitions, funded partly by debt despite $36.8B operating cash flow.  <br>- Profitability decline contributed to reduced coverage capacity, with operating income falling 50% year-over-year due to inflationary pressures and operational restructuring costs.  <br>- Higher financial risk emerges from debt dependency, with total debt representing 46% of 2022 liabilities ($67.2B/$316.6B), up from 40% in 2021.

          - DSO increased from 26 days (2021) to 30 days (2022), indicating slower receivables collection; sales growth outpaced collections despite $21.9B receivables decrease in 2022 vs. $18.2B in 2021.  <br>- DIO remained stable at 43 days both years, reflecting consistent inventory turnover; inventory decreases slowed to $2.6B in 2022 vs. $9.5B in 2021.  <br>- DPO decreased from 104 days (2021) to 99 days (2022), suggesting faster supplier payments; accounts payable growth slowed to $2.9B in 2022 vs. $3.6B in 2021.  <br>- CCC deteriorated from -35 days (2021) to -26 days (2022) due to higher DSO and lower DPO, despite stable operating cash flows (~$46.7B in 2022 vs. $46.3B in 2021).  <br>- Increased short-term debt borrowings in 2022 provided liquidity but were partially offset by tighter supplier payment terms.  <br>- Stable inventory management aligned with efficient supply chain operations despite CCC efficiency decline.  <br>- Negative CCC in both years maintained overall cash management strength, though 2022 showed reduced optimization.

        Amazon's financial performance has deteriorated significantly, with a decline in net income, profitability margins, and key financial ratios such as ROA and ROE. Increased operating expenses and higher debt levels, coupled with weaker liquidity and solvency positions, suggest ongoing challenges. Without significant improvements in cost management and operational efficiency, EPS is likely to decrease next year.
