          - Net revenue from products decreased from 77.8% to 58.8% (-19.0%), while subscriptions/services increased from 22.1% to 41.1% (+19.0%) of total revenue.  <br>- Gross margin declined 5.8% to 63.1% due to increased amortization of acquisition-related intangibles (+6.5% to 11.7%) and higher total operating expenses (+13.2% to 36.9%).  <br>- Operating income fell 19.2% to 26.1% of revenue, with net income declining 27.9% to 11.4% despite 44.1% total revenue growth and 31.7% gross profit growth.  <br>- Total assets grew 127.3% driven by intangible assets increasing from 5.30% to 24.50% (+19.20%) of assets, while cash reserves fell from 19.45% to 5.64% (-13.81%).  <br>- Long-term debt decreased from 76.95% to 67.70% (-9.25%) of liabilities, offset by increased other long-term liabilities (+7.41% to 15.28%).  <br>- Shareholders' equity surged 182.0% with additional paid-in capital rising from 87.90% to 99.70% (+11.80%), while retained earnings dropped from 11.18% to 0% (-11.18%).  <br>- Total liabilities increased 100.5% year-over-year, outpaced by asset growth but contributing to a 58.1% net income decline despite revenue expansion.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross Margin Ratio declined from 69% (2023) to 63% (2024) due to increased cost of goods sold from VMware acquisition-related expenses.  <br>- Operating Margin decreased from 45% to 26%, reflecting higher operating expenses and integration costs linked to the acquisition.  <br>- Net Profit Margin fell from 39.3% to 11.4% due to lower operating income and increased expenses from acquisition activities.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) dropped from 19.3% to 3.56%, indicating reduced asset efficiency from integration challenges and intangible asset impacts.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) declined from 58.7% to 8.7% due to lower net income and increased equity following the acquisition.  <br>- Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) decreased from 24.8% to 9.0%, reflecting diminished returns from integration costs and capital utilization inefficiencies.  <br>- VMware's acquisition in November 2023 drove higher COGS, operating expenses, and integration costs, compressing margins and reducing profitability metrics.  <br>- Short-term financial impacts included potential write-downs of intangible assets and operational inefficiencies, contributing to declines in gross, operating, and net margins.  <br>- Reduced ROA and ROE reflect challenges in asset and equity efficiency post-acquisition, driven by increased capital deployment and integration complexity.

        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined to 1.17 in 2024 (from higher 2023 level) as current liabilities surged 125% to $16,697M, primarily due to short-term debt from VMware acquisition outpacing current asset growth.  <br>- Quick ratio improved slightly to 0.83 through better liquid asset management, potentially from increased contract assets, despite overall liquidity pressures.  <br>- Cash ratio fell to 0.56 as cash reserves dropped 34% to $9,348M, driven by $14B+ in acquisition costs (VMware, Seagate SoC), dividend hikes, and stock buybacks.  <br>- Strategic cash allocation prioritized long-term growth via acquisitions ($69B VMware merger) and shareholder returns, constraining short-term liquidity buffers.  <br>- Current liabilities tripled year-over-year, with VMware-related obligations accounting for $7B+ of the $16.7B total, increasing near-term repayment risks.  <br>- Cash outflows exceeded $20B in 2024 for M&A and capital returns, leaving minimal flexibility for unexpected liquidity needs despite improved receivables management.  <br>- While core liquidity metrics remain above crisis thresholds, declining cash coverage (56% of liabilities vs 192% in 2023) necessitates tighter working capital controls.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio improved from 2.04 to 1.45 (2023-2024) due to 181% equity growth ($23,988M to $67,678M) outpacing 100% liability growth ($48,873M to $97,967M), supported by retained earnings and share repurchases (67 million shares retired).  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio declined from 10.00 to 3.41 as operating income dropped 17% ($16,207M to $13,463M) and interest expense rose 144% ($1,622M to $3,953M), driven by VMware-related amortization/restructuring and $39,954M new debt.  <br>- Solvency Ratio improved from 2.04 to 1.45, reflecting stronger equity positioning from share issuances and retained earnings despite $7,176M in share buybacks.  <br>- VMware acquisition added $45,572M in intangible assets, increased liabilities, and contributed to equity via share issuances, financed by $25,978M net cash outflow and debt/equity mix.  <br>- Total liabilities doubled while equity grew 181%, influenced by acquisition financing and capital strategies (e.g., $39,954M debt raised alongside equity expansion).  <br>- Operating income decrease tied to VMware integration costs (higher amortization, restructuring) and increased interest burdens from new debt instruments.  <br>- Cash flow from financing surged by $13,890M, primarily from $39,954M debt proceeds offsetting $7,176M share repurchases, balancing acquisition funding with capital returns.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO decreased from 32.1 to 31.4 days due to strong collections and factoring arrangements for receivables, accelerating cash inflows.  <br>- DIO dropped significantly from 74.5 to 50.3 days, reflecting improved inventory turnover and higher contract assets from software revenue recognition timing.  <br>- DPO slightly decreased from 47.6 to 46.4 days, showing efficient supplier payment management supported by increased accounts payable without straining relationships.  <br>- CCC improved from 59.0 to 35.3 days, driven by enhanced inventory turnover, faster receivables collection, and optimized payables management, freeing working capital.  <br>- Inventory management efficiency increased through reduced days inventory outstanding (74.5 to 50.3 days), aligning with higher contract asset balances.  <br>- Accounts receivable collection improvements (32.1 to 31.4 DSO) were achieved despite revenue growth, indicating effective credit control practices.  <br>- Accounts payable management maintained balance between extended payment terms (47.6 to 46.4 DPO) and supplier relationship sustainability.  <br>- Overall cash flow efficiency gains stemmed from synchronized improvements across all three CCC components (DSO, DIO, DPO).

        Based on the financial statements and analysis, Broadcom's earnings per share (EPS) is expected to decrease next year. The company faces significant challenges including rising operating expenses, increased debt from the VMware acquisition, and declining profitability margins. Despite revenue growth, the faster growth of costs and expenses, along with integration challenges, are likely to continue pressuring EPS. Without substantial cost management improvements or realization of acquisition synergies, EPS is anticipated to decline.
