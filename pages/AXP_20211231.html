          - Current Ratio remained unchanged at 0.778 in 2020 and 2021 due to stable current assets and liabilities, though below 1 suggests potential liquidity challenges.  <br>- Quick Ratio stayed at 0.778 both years, reflecting consistent coverage of short-term obligations with liquid assets (excluding inventory) matching liability stability.  <br>- Cash Ratio declined from 0.335 (2020) to 0.226 (2021) as cash/cash equivalents dropped 33% ($32,965M to $22,028M), reducing immediate cash liquidity.  <br>- Stable current assets/liabilities maintained Current and Quick Ratios, while the $10.9B cash reserve reduction drove the Cash Ratio decline.  <br>- Overall liquidity remains stable with manageable short-term obligations, but the cash position weakening requires monitoring despite broader liquidity consistency.

          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio increased slightly (7.32 to 7.5) due to $1.6 billion preferred shares issuance and $7.6 billion common share repurchases (Notes 16, 22), increasing liabilities and reducing equity.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio improved significantly (2.05 to 8.33), driven by higher net income (Note 25) and CECL methodology phase-in (Note 22), enhancing interest obligation coverage.  <br>- Equity Ratio declined marginally (12.0% to 11.8%) from share repurchases reducing equity and slight total asset growth (Note 22).  <br>- Increased leverage and reduced equity reflect strategic capital management focused on shareholder returns, balanced by stronger profitability and interest coverage capacity.
