          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin declined from 14.2% (2022) to 13.8% (2023) due to 14% revenue growth outpacing 11% net income growth, driven by 10% expense increases in Card Member rewards and employee benefits.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) decreased from 3.3% to 3.2% as 14% asset growth (notably 17% increase in Card Member loans/receivables) exceeded 11% net income growth, with higher credit loss provisions.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) dipped from 30.4% to 29.8% despite $5.3B shareholder returns, as 14% equity growth outpaced 11% net income growth.  <br>- Operating profit margin fell from 18.1% to 17.4% as 14% revenue growth exceeded 10% pretax income growth, with EMEA regions showing slower profit growth due to rising costs.  <br>- Total revenues increased 14% ($52.9B to $60.5B) driven by discount revenue and card fees, but offset by 10% expense growth and 125% surge in credit loss provisions from loan delinquencies.  <br>- Asset base expanded 14% ($228B to $261B) primarily from Card Member loans/receivables, contributing to higher credit risk exposure and reduced asset efficiency.  <br>- Profitability challenges stem from operating costs (rewards, salaries) and credit provisions growing faster than revenue, despite strong billed business volumes and travel spending recovery.  <br>- Regional performance varied, with operating costs in EMEA limiting profit growth despite revenue increases across all geographic segments.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved marginally (2023: 0.744 vs. 2022: 0.737) as both current assets and liabilities grew, but liability growth slightly outpaced asset growth.  <br>- Quick ratio increased to 0.326 from 0.276 due to higher cash/cash equivalents ($46.6B in 2023 vs. $33.9B in 2022), though rising current liabilities limited improvement.  <br>- Cash ratio rose to 0.324 from 0.274, reflecting increased cash reserves, but investment income on liquidity resources remained below funding costs.  <br>- Operating cash flow ratio improved to 0.0926 from 0.0783, supported by diversified funding strategies (secured borrowing, credit facilities), yet remains insufficient for liabilities.  <br>- All liquidity ratios stayed below 1, indicating reliance on non-cash assets and persistent challenges meeting short-term obligations despite marginal gains.  <br>- Long-term debt issuance (fixed/floating-rate notes) in 2023 increased liabilities, constraining liquidity ratio improvements despite higher cash reserves.  <br>- Liquidity management includes $48B in committed credit facilities, but operational cash flow covers only 9.26% of current liabilities, signaling ongoing fragility.  <br>- Concurrent 13% growth in both current assets and liabilities in 2023 resulted in minimal net ratio improvements, maintaining a precarious liquidity position.

          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio rose from 8.24x (2022) to 8.3x (2023) due to increased long-term debt (+$5.3B to $47,866M), outpacing equity growth.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio fell from 4.47x to 2.53x as interest expense surged from $2.2B to $6.4B, driven by higher debt and rising interest rates.  <br>- Equity Ratio declined slightly from 10.8% to 10.7% as total assets grew faster (+$261B) than equity expansion ($28.1B).  <br>- Total liabilities reached $233B (2023) vs. $28.1B equity, reflecting heightened reliance on debt financing.  <br>- Interest expense consumed 65% of EBIT ($17.4B) in 2023 vs. 22% in 2022, reducing earnings coverage capacity.  <br>- Fixed/floating rate debt instruments contributed to increased leverage, with long-term debt rising 12% year-over-year.  <br>- Asset base expanded by 5.7% ($261B total assets), diluting equity's share despite absolute equity growth.

        Despite a slight decrease in net profit margin and increasing expenses, American Express has shown consistent revenue and net income growth. The company's improved cash conversion cycle and efficient management of working capital are positive indicators. While rising debt and expenses are concerns, the overall trend suggests that EPS will likely increase next year.
