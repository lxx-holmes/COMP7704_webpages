        Risks:  <br>- Prolonged COVID-19 impacts may disrupt operations, increase credit losses, and strain liquidity due to economic uncertainty and supply chain challenges.  <br>- Market volatility and interest rate fluctuations could reduce asset values, increase funding costs, and pressure trading revenue.  <br>- Cybersecurity breaches or operational failures in third-party systems may disrupt services, increase costs, and damage reputation.  <br>- Regulatory changes and compliance requirements, including climate-related mandates, may restrict business activities and increase operational costs.  <br>- Concentrated credit exposures in real estate, finance companies, and energy sectors heighten vulnerability to sector-specific downturns.  <br><br>Opportunities:  <br>- Growth in digital banking adoption and AI-driven services enhances customer engagement and operational efficiency.  <br>- Expansion in wealth management and asset management fees driven by rising client assets and market participation.  <br>- Increased investment banking and trading revenue from higher client activity in equities and fixed-income products.  <br>- Strategic cost management initiatives and efficiency programs aim to improve profitability and resource allocation.  <br>- Participation in government relief programs (e.g., PPP) strengthens customer relationships and fee income despite pandemic risks.

          - Net Profit Margin increased from 20.9% (2020) to 35.8% (2021), driven by net income growth from $17,894M to $31,978M, outpacing revenue growth from $85,528M to $89,113M.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) rose from 0.63% to 1.01% as net income growth exceeded asset expansion from $2,819,627M to $3,169,495M.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) improved from 6.56% to 11.83% primarily due to higher net income, despite a slight equity decline from $272,924M to $270,066M.  <br>- Efficiency Ratio deteriorated from 64.5% to 67.0% due to rising noninterest expenses, including accrued expenses increasing from $15,965M to $17,394M.  <br>- Operational performance improvements, particularly in the U.S. segment, drove profitability gains, while expense management challenges impacted efficiency.  <br>- Adoption of a new credit loss accounting principle in 2020 may have influenced 2021‚Äôs financial results.  <br>- Shareholder returns strengthened significantly, but sustained efficiency requires better cost control.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved slightly from 0.76 (2020) to 0.77 (2021), remaining below 1 but typical for financial institutions, supported by a 43% increase in debt securities despite 16% growth in current liabilities from deposits/borrowings.  <br>- Quick ratio mirrored current ratio trends at 0.76 (2020) to 0.77 (2021), reflecting comparable liquidity coverage through liquid assets.  <br>- Operating cash flow ratio rose from 1.42% (2020) to 1.54% (2021), indicating marginally improved cash flow management while remaining low due to sector norms.  <br>- Current assets grew 16% ($1,568,225M to $1,828,648M), driven by debt securities expansion offsetting an 8% reduction in cash holdings.  <br>- Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) declined from 122% to 115% but stayed above the 100% regulatory threshold, demonstrating maintained liquidity buffers.  <br>- Strategic asset reallocation prioritized liquid debt securities over cash, enhancing liquidity management flexibility despite lower cash reserves.  <br>- Liability growth aligned with asset expansion (16% increase in both current assets/liabilities), reflecting balanced funding source diversification.  <br>- Stability prioritized through cautious liquidity approaches, including asset allocation adjustments and operational cash flow optimization.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased from 9.33 (2020) to 10.74 (2021) due to $17.2 billion rise in long-term debt from new issuances and $2.9 billion equity decrease from stock repurchases/dividends.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio improved sharply from 2.31 to 7.17, driven by $14.1 billion net income growth (from $17.9B to $31.98B) and $3.5 billion interest expense reduction (from $8.23B to $4.74B).  <br>- Higher leverage reflects strategic $76.7 billion long-term debt issuance in 2021 for growth initiatives, with reduced borrowing costs lowering interest rates on debt.  <br>- Enhanced profitability and debt optimization strategies strengthened debt-servicing capacity despite increased leverage.  <br>- Shareholders' equity declined marginally due to capital return actions, while earnings growth offset higher liability levels.

          - DSO increased from 3650 days (2020) to 4015 days (2021), indicating slower customer collections due to economic conditions, customer payment behavior shifts, and adoption of new credit loss accounting standards impacting provisions.  <br>- DPO rose from 11,550 days (2020) to 12,629 days (2021), reflecting extended supplier payment terms for cash conservation, supported by securities financing agreements and renegotiated supplier agreements.  <br>- CCC worsened by 9% (from -7,900 days in 2020 to -8,614 days in 2021), driven by slower collections and delayed payments, signaling liquidity risks from paying suppliers faster than customer cash conversion.  <br>- Negative CCC highlights operational inefficiency, with cash outflow to suppliers outpacing inflow from customers, creating potential working capital strain despite short-term cash flow management benefits.  <br>- Economic downturns and industry-specific challenges contributed to delayed receivables, while strategic cash retention via increased deposits and financing activities influenced longer payable periods.  <br>- Accounting changes, including credit loss standard adoption, altered cash flow reporting and loss provisions, indirectly affecting DSO and liquidity metrics.
