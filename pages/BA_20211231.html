        Risks:  <br>- Continued supplier disruptions and part shortages may disrupt production, increase costs, and delay deliveries.  <br>- Liquidity challenges due to $58.1B debt, negative operating cash flows, and potential difficulty accessing credit markets.  <br>- Customer defaults and reduced demand for commercial aircraft due to prolonged airline industry recovery from COVID-19.  <br>- Regulatory, legal, and financial risks from 737 MAX recertification delays, production bottlenecks, and unresolved litigation.  <br>- Pension obligations and postretirement benefits totaling $5.5B in 2021 could strain cash flows and equity.  <br><br>Opportunities:  <br>- 737 MAX recertification and return to service in most markets may stabilize delivery schedules and revenue.  <br>- Defense contracts (e.g., KC-46A Tanker, fighter aircraft) provide stable revenue amid commercial market volatility.  <br>- Growth in Global Services from increased commercial fleet support and government contracts post-pandemic recovery.  <br>- CARES Act tax refunds ($1.7B in 2021) and operational streamlining efforts to improve liquidity and reduce costs.  <br>- Long-term demand recovery for single-aisle and wide-body aircraft as air traffic rebounds to pre-COVID levels.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 1.40 (2020) to 1.33 (2021) due to a 10.7% drop in current assets ($121,642M to $108,666M) from reduced commercial deliveries and 787/777X program delays, outpacing current liabilities reduction ($87,280M to $81,992M).  <br>- Quick ratio fell sharply from 0.46 to 0.36 as inventory buildup (undelivered 787/777X aircraft) reduced liquid assets, leaving only $108,666M - inventories to cover $81,992M liabilities.  <br>- Cash ratio marginally improved from 0.088 to 0.098 with cash reserves rising from $7,752M to $8,052M, though still insufficient relative to $81,992M liabilities despite $9.8B debt issuance for refinancing.  <br>- Operational challenges included $3.4B negative operating cash flow (2021), pandemic-driven air travel declines, and 737 MAX grounding impacts, limiting liquidity recovery.  <br>- Inventory management pressures grew with $8,052M cash representing only 9.8% of current liabilities, forcing reliance on non-cash assets and slowing production rates to conserve liquidity.  <br>- Strategic cash conservation measures included workforce reductions, suspended share buybacks, and debt management, but failed to offset $58.1B total debt burden and program-specific delays.  <br>- Liquidity erosion highlighted need for improved aircraft delivery rates, inventory monetization, or liability reductions to strengthen the 1.33 current ratio and 0.36 quick ratio positioning.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio worsened from -9.42x (2020) to -10.33x (2021) due to liabilities decreasing $16.8B but equity deficit remaining severe ($14.8B vs $18.1B), reflecting persistent negative equity and insolvency risk.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio improved from -7.67x to -2.87x (2021) driven by reduced net loss ($4.3B vs $11.9B) and $13.8B debt repayment, though EBIT (-$7.7B) still failed to cover interest expenses.  <br>- Financial Leverage Ratio deteriorated from -8.42x to -9.32x (2021) as total assets declined $13.6B while equity deficit narrowed insufficiently, amplifying leverage risks despite liquidity management efforts.  <br>- Total liabilities decreased $16.8B in 2021 through $9.8B senior note issuance and $13.8B term loan repayment, improving liquidity ($16.2B cash + $14.7B credit capacity) without resolving structural solvency issues.  <br>- Operational challenges ‚Äì COVID-19 impacts, 787 production delays, and 737 MAX fallout ‚Äì depressed revenues and cash flows, necessitating workforce reductions and production cuts to conserve liquidity.  <br>- Negative equity (-$14.8B in 2021) and sustained EBIT losses (-$7.7B) highlight inability to generate sufficient earnings to service debt, maintaining high insolvency risk despite marginal ratio improvements.  <br>- Times Interest Earned Ratio remained negative at -2.87x (2021) vs -7.67x (2020), showing persistent failure to cover interest obligations through operating profits despite reduced interest expenses.

          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) increased from -14.9 days (2020) to 7.0 days (2021), driven by reduced Days Payable Outstanding (DPO), slower collections, and inventory turnover amid operational disruptions.  <br>- DPO decreased from 74.0 days (2020) to 57.1 days (2021), reflecting faster supplier payments, which shortened CCC but were offset by slower receivables and inventory turnover.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) rose from 12.3 days (2020) to 15.5 days (2021), indicating prolonged customer collections and contributing to longer CCC.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) increased from 46.8 days (2020) to 48.6 days (2021) due to 737 MAX/787 program delays, production disruptions, and inventory buildup, extending CCC.  <br>- COVID-19 reduced air travel demand, leading to lower aircraft deliveries, negative operating cash flows, and production rate cuts, impairing working capital efficiency.  <br>- Production challenges included $1.4 billion in 737 MAX reach-forward losses and 787 delivery pauses, exacerbating inventory turnover delays and liquidity strain.  <br>- Boeing issued debt to bolster liquidity but faced high leverage and negative cash flows, complicating cash management despite improved payables efficiency.  <br>- Payables management improvements partially offset slower receivables and inventory turnover, but overall CCC increase highlights persistent operational and market headwinds.

        While Boeing showed improvement in reducing its net loss and managing costs better, the company still faces significant challenges such as negative equity, high debt, and ongoing production issues. These factors suggest that despite progress, next year's earnings per share are likely to decrease as the company continues to navigate through financial distress and industry challenges.
