        <!-- Your text goes here. -->
        **Risks:**  <br>- Fixed-price contracts expose Boeing to potential losses from cost overruns, particularly on defense programs like KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  <br>- Heavy reliance on U.S. government contracts (40% of 2022 revenue) subjects operations to audits, funding uncertainties, and termination risks.  <br>- Pension and postretirement obligations ($2.2B net actuarial loss in 2022) strain cash flows and shareholders‚Äô equity due to market volatility.  <br>- Unionized workforce (32% of employees) risks production disruptions from labor disputes, impacting delivery schedules and customer relationships.  <br>- Legal liabilities from 737 MAX accidents and unresolved arbitration with Embraer over terminated joint ventures could result in material financial penalties.  <br><br>**Opportunities:**  <br>- Commercial Airplanes segment growth driven by 737 MAX recertification and resumed 787 deliveries, with $19.3B backlog in BGS services.  <br>- Defense programs like MQ-25 and VC-25B Presidential Aircraft offer long-term revenue streams amid global security demand.  <br>- Global Services expansion into logistics, maintenance, and digital analytics capitalizes on post-pandemic airline fleet reactivation.  <br>- Strategic alliances (e.g., United Launch Alliance) and space exploration partnerships position Boeing in growing defense and space markets.  <br>- $404B total backlog (as of December 2022) provides visibility into future revenues across commercial, defense, and services segments.

        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin worsened (-7.6% vs. -6.9%) due to $5.253B increased operating losses from fixed-price contracts (VC-25B, KC-46A) absorbing cost overruns.  <br>- Operating profit margin declined (-5.3% vs. -4.7%) as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and production delays increased expenses faster than revenues.  <br>- ROA deteriorated (-3.7% vs. -3.1%) from 787 rework costs, 777X certification delays, and $2.8B cumulative losses across defense/space programs.  <br>- ROE improved (31.9% vs. 28.9%) due to higher net losses relative to negative equity (-$15.8B), reflecting severe financial strain from liabilities exceeding assets.  <br>- Gross margin slightly increased (5.3% vs. 4.9%) through better production cost management, partially offsetting broader operational inefficiencies.  <br>- Profitability decline driven by fixed-price contract risks, $2.1B abnormal production costs, and $1.5B higher commercial airplane unit costs despite 40% revenue growth.  <br>- Negative shareholders' equity (-$15.8B) underscores structural financial stress, with $3.1B pension liability adjustments further eroding equity.  <br>- Program accounting adjustments caused $1.4B 787 losses and 777X margin compression, exposing vulnerability to future certification delays.

          - Current ratio declined from 1.33 (2021) to 1.21 (2022), reflecting reduced ability to cover short-term liabilities despite cash reserves increasing from $8,052M to $14,614M, as revenue growth ($62,286M to $66,608M) lagged liability increases.  <br>- Quick ratio remained stable at 0.35-0.36, indicating persistent reliance on inventory sales due to significant Commercial Airplanes segment inventory ($2,370M operational loss) and long operating cycles per accounting policies.  <br>- Cash ratio improved from 0.10 to 0.16 driven by operating cash flow growth ($3,017M to $3,502M) and $4,370M net investing inflows, enhancing ability to meet obligations with cash alone.  <br>- Liquidity position remains stable overall but requires improved inventory management, particularly in segments with slow asset turnover, as current assets (excluding cash) failed to keep pace with rising liabilities.  <br>- Working capital efficiency challenges stem from long operational cycles exceeding one year, evidenced by high BCA inventory levels and slower accounts receivable turnover per financial note disclosures.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio improved slightly from -10.33x (2021) to -9.65x (2022) due to a $1.1B debt reduction, but equity deficit worsened from -$14.846B to -$15.848B due to Commercial Airplanes segment losses.  <br>- Debt-to-Asset ratio increased from 1.107x to 1.115x as assets declined from $138.552B to $137.100B while debt remained elevated at $57.0B (2022).  <br>- Interest coverage ratio improved marginally from 2.88x to 2.98x despite lower operating income, driven by reduced interest expenses ($2,682M to $2,533M).  <br>- Solvency ratio declined from 0.903 to 0.896, reflecting reduced asset coverage of liabilities (total liabilities $152.948B vs. assets $137.100B in 2022).  <br>- Long-term debt remained high at $57.0B (2022), with short-term debt increasing from $1.3B to $5.2B year-over-year.  <br>- Negative equity position worsened to -$15.848B (2022) due to $2.370B loss in Commercial Airplanes segment and accumulated deficits.  <br>- Purchase obligations surged 96% from $62.025B (2021) to $121.540B (2022), amplifying liability pressures.  <br>- Operational challenges included $7.5B cumulative Commercial Airplanes losses since 2019 and increased R&D expenses.  <br>- Liquidity remains at $14.6B cash (2022), but solvency risks persist from debt maturity walls and negative equity.

        Boeing's financial statements indicate increasing net losses, worsening operating margins, and negative equity, all of which suggest ongoing financial difficulties. Despite slight improvements in certain areas like revenue growth and inventory management, the overall trend in profitability is negative. These factors collectively point to a likely decrease in earnings per share next year.
