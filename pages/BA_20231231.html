        - Continued development of the 777X program and 737-7/737-10 derivatives, with 787 deliveries driving higher Commercial Airplanes revenue in 2023 despite supply chain disruptions and FAA scrutiny after the Alaska Airlines 737-9 incident.  <br>- Defense, Space & Security reduced losses by $1.8B in 2023 through lower charges on fixed-price programs (KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, MQ-25), though technical challenges and a $315M satellite customer agreement impacted performance.  <br>- Global Services grew commercial revenue 15.5% YoY in 2023, leveraging data analytics, predictive maintenance, and digital solutions as air travel recovered to pre-pandemic levels.  <br>- Expanded workforce by 15,000 employees (9.6%) in 2023, hiring 23,000 new employees with 82% acceptance rate, while increasing workforce diversity to 35% U.S. racial/ethnic minorities and 15% veterans.  <br>- Invested 6.9M employee training hours in 2023, with 13,000 employees using tuition assistance for technical/leadership development, supporting innovation in aerospace technologies.  <br>- Faced ongoing supply chain constraints and labor instability across segments, contributing to $2.9B in net unfavorable cumulative contract adjustments in 2023 and deferred 737 MAX production rate increases.  <br>- Strengthened cybersecurity and product safety governance through board-level oversight, employee training, and partnerships following FAA mandates after the 737-9 door plug incident.  <br>- Increased focus on equity and inclusion with 176 global Business Resource Groups (15,000+ participants) and third annual Global Equity report highlighting workforce diversity metrics.  <br>- Defense segment grew backlog by $4.6B in 2023 despite competition from Lockheed Martin, SpaceX, and Airbus, prioritizing next-gen programs like hypersonics and autonomous systems.  <br>- Deployed digital services across commercial fleets through BGS, including predictive maintenance and logistics optimization tools, capitalizing on airline demand for operational efficiency.

          - Total revenue increased by 16.8% (from $66,608M in 2022 to $77,794M in 2023), with no significant changes in percentage of total revenue composition.  <br>- Gross profit surged 118.8% (from $3,530M to $7,724M), while income from operations improved 69.8% (reducing loss from $3,519M to $773M).  <br>- Net income loss decreased 55.7% (from $5,053M to $2,242M), reflecting overall operational improvements across key metrics.  <br>- Total assets remained stable (-0.064% change), total liabilities saw minor growth (0.845%), and shareholders' equity decreased 8.7% (below 10% significance threshold).  <br>- No material changes in balance sheet composition percentages (assets, liabilities, or equity) exceeding ¬±5% thresholds.  <br>- Year-over-year balance sheet growth rates for assets, liabilities, and equity were all deemed non-significant per analysis criteria.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin improved from -7.41% (2022) to -2.86% (2023) due to 55% reduced net loss and 16.5% revenue growth spreading fixed costs  <br>- Operating profit margin rose from -5.28% to -0.99% through operational efficiency improvements nearing breakeven  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) increased from -3.60% to -1.62% via better asset utilization and cost management  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) decreased from 31.10% to 12.90% but remains elevated due to negative equity (-$17.2B in 2023), signaling leverage risks  <br>- Gross profit margin doubled from 5.5% to 10.0% through reduced cost of goods sold relative to revenue  <br>- Total revenues grew 16.5% ($66.6B to $77.8B) driven by increased product/service sales  <br>- Net loss narrowed by 55% ($4.9B to $2.2B) demonstrating improved cost control  <br>- Negative shareholders' equity persists (-$15.9B in 2022 to -$17.2B in 2023) reflecting accumulated losses and high debt  <br>- All profitability ratios show improvement but company remains unprofitable with uncertain long-term sustainability  <br>- Progress attributed to cost efficiencies and revenue growth, offset partially by ongoing leverage concerns

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current Ratio declined from 1.22x (2022) to 1.14x (2023), driven by increased current liabilities (accrued liabilities rose from $21,581M to $22,331M) and stable current assets despite revenue growth.  <br>- Quick Ratio dropped from 0.35x (2022) to 0.31x (2023), reflecting reduced cash/cash equivalents ($14,614M to $12,691M) and exclusion of higher inventory balances from liquid assets.  <br>- Higher inventories tied up cash, reducing liquidity buffers and disproportionately impacting the Quick Ratio.  <br>- Increased customer concessions and considerations related to the 737 MAX program contributed to rising current liabilities.  <br>- Stable current assets failed to offset liability growth, compressing liquidity ratios.  <br>- Operating Cash Flow Ratio could not be calculated due to insufficient operating cash flow data disclosure.  <br>- Declining liquidity signals reduced financial flexibility, challenging Boeing‚Äôs ability to invest or manage short-term obligations.  <br>- Working capital management, particularly inventory optimization and liability control, is critical for liquidity improvement.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio was not meaningful in 2023 and 2022 due to negative equity, with liabilities exceeding assets both years, signaling severe financial instability.  <br>- Debt-to-Asset ratio increased from 1.115 (2022) to 1.125 (2023), driven by a $5.2B rise in long-term debt to $52,799M, reflecting higher financial leverage.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio remained negative in both years due to operating losses ($4,935M in 2023 vs. $3,519M in 2022), showing inability to cover interest expenses with earnings.  <br>- Pension/postretirement liabilities rose $495M to $8,077M (2023), while purchase obligations surged $61,963M to $141,122M, amplifying solvency risks.  <br>- Negative equity and worsening operational performance (deepening losses) intensified concerns about long-term viability and capacity to meet financial obligations.  <br>- Debt growth, escalating liabilities, and persistent operational losses collectively deteriorated solvency metrics, indicating heightened financial risk.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved from 407 days (2022) to 365 days (2023), driven by a 42-day reduction in working capital inefficiencies.  <br>- DIO decreased from 452 to 415 days due to optimized production/supply chain efficiency, air traffic recovery, and resolved supply chain disruptions.  <br>- DSO improved from 14 to 12 days, reflecting faster receivables collection from enhanced cash management and higher 2023 revenues.  <br>- DPO increased from 59 to 62 days as Boeing negotiated longer supplier payment terms to conserve cash amid inflationary pressures.  <br>- Inventory turnover accelerated despite marginal inventory value growth ($78.15B to $79.74B), indicating better demand alignment and operational execution.  <br>- CCC gains were supported by commercial aviation market stabilization and strategic focus on working capital optimization per MD&A disclosures.  <br>- Extended payables strategy offset ongoing supply chain challenges, balancing cash flow preservation with supplier relationships.

        Despite improvements in revenue growth and cost management, Boeing's persistent negative equity, high debt levels, and ongoing losses suggest continued financial challenges. These factors, along with industry competition and risks from fixed-price contracts, make it likely that EPS will decrease next year.
