          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio decreased from 1.53 (2020) to 1.45 (2021) as current liabilities grew 16% ($25,717M to $29,847M) compared to 10% current asset growth ($39,464M to $43,455M).  <br>- Quick ratio declined from 1.09 to 0.986 due to a $2.6B inventory increase ($11,402M to $14,038M) being excluded from this ratio calculation.  <br>- Cash ratio dropped from 0.36 to 0.31 as cash reserves decreased slightly ($9,352M to $9,254M) while current liabilities expanded.  <br>- Reduced liquidity ratios indicate tighter short-term financial flexibility, particularly regarding inventory-dependent obligations.  <br>- Inventory growth suggests potential turnover challenges, requiring management attention to optimize working capital efficiency.  <br>- Despite declines, ratios remain within stable operational ranges, though continued monitoring of liability management is advised.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-equity ratio decreased from 4.09 (2020) to 4.02 (2021) due to $500 million debt repayment, equity growth from retained earnings ($7.5B 2021 net income), and $871M increase in operating cash flow reducing debt reliance.  <br>- Interest coverage ratio improved significantly from 8.86 (2020) to 14.08 (2021), supported by higher EBIT and reduced interest expenses from strategic debt management.  <br>- Times interest earned ratio nearly doubled from 7.77 (2020) to 16.81 (2021), reflecting stronger pre-tax profit generation relative to interest obligations.  <br>- Equity increased through unrealized gains in securities ($1.2B AOCI growth) and retained earnings, offsetting a minor $0.3B total debt increase from new issuances.  <br>- Operating cash flow growth enabled debt reduction without compromising investments, with $6.6B allocated to machinery/energy R&D in 2021.  <br>- Structured refinancing activities maintained debt maturity profile while optimizing interest costs, contributing to improved solvency metrics.

          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved from 130.3 days (2020) to 121.1 days (2021), a 9.2-day reduction driven by faster collections and extended payables.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) decreased from 63.9 to 60.7 days due to enhanced receivables management and improved collection processes, boosting liquidity.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) increased from 76.9 to 83.9 days, reflecting extended supplier payment terms that retained cash longer and improved cash flow.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) remained stable at 144.3 days (2021) vs. 143.3 days (2020), indicating consistent inventory turnover and management practices.  <br>- The combined effect of reduced DSO and increased DPO demonstrates optimized cash flow management, while steady DIO shows no material operational inefficiencies.  <br>- The CCC improvement reflects stronger cash conversion efficiency through better working capital strategies in receivables and payables.
