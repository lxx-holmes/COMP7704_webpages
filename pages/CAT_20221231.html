          - Goodwill impairment charge increased from 0% in 2021 to 1.56% of total revenue in 2022 but remained below the 5% significance threshold.  <br>- Total revenue grew 16.58% YoY (2021 to 2022), with gross profit up 16.93% and income from operations increasing 14.91%, reflecting strong revenue and profit growth.  <br>- Treasury stock decreased by 5.39% of total equity (from -33.37% in 2021 to -38.76% in 2022), signaling a shift in equity structure.  <br>- Profit employed in the business rose 5.68% of total equity (47.43% to 53.11% YoY), indicating higher reinvestment or profitability.  <br>- Total assets declined 1.03% YoY ($82,793 to $81,943), while total liabilities decreased 0.34% ($66,277 to $66,052) and shareholders‚Äô equity fell 3.79% ($16,516 to $15,891).

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin decreased from 12.7% (2021) to 11.3% (2022) due to $925M goodwill impairment, $193M Rail division restructuring costs, and higher material/freight expenses.  <br>- Operating profit margin declined slightly from 13.5% to 13.3% driven by manufacturing inefficiencies, inventory write-downs, and restructuring charges.  <br>- ROA improved from 7.8% to 8.2% as asset turnover increased from 0.615x to 0.725x, reflecting 18% higher sales generation from assets.  <br>- ROE rose from 39.3% to 42.2% through more efficient equity allocation despite margin pressures, potentially aided by reduced equity levels.  <br>- Gross profit margin edged up from 30.3% to 30.4% as pricing strategies and sales volume growth offset $2.6B increase in cost of goods sold.  <br>- $41M IRS tax settlement benefit partially mitigated net income impacts from restructuring and impairment charges.  <br>- Sales/revenue increased 13% year-over-year ($55B to $62B) driven by price realization and volume growth across segments.  <br>- Goodwill impairment ($925M) and Rail division restructuring ($193M) reduced operating profit by 1.1% collectively.  <br>- Manufacturing costs rose due to supply chain constraints and material inflation, contributing to 70bps operating margin compression.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined slightly from 1.45 (2021) to 1.39 (2022), indicating minor weakening in covering short-term obligations while remaining in a safe position.  <br>- Quick ratio decreased from 0.89 to 0.79, reflecting reduced liquidity in highly liquid assets and increased reliance on inventory to meet short-term obligations.  <br>- Cash ratio dropped significantly from 0.31 to 0.22 due to a $1.1B reduction in cash reserves (2021: $9.3B to 2022: $8.2B) alongside rising current liabilities.  <br>- Current liabilities increased, with $8.69B reported in short-term obligations for 2023, driven by invoices, contractual commitments, and working capital requirements.  <br>- Operating cash flow declined from $7.18B (2021) to $6.36B (2022) due to short-term incentive payments, higher taxes, and unfavorable working capital changes.  <br>- $4.23B common stock repurchase in 2022 further reduced cash reserves, exacerbating liquidity pressures.  <br>- Working capital challenges included increased accounts payable and inventory adjustments, straining cash flow management.  <br>- Company maintains ability to meet obligations but requires enhanced cash reserves or improved liability management to strengthen liquidity position.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased from 4.02 (2021) to 4.15 (2022) due to equity reduction from $4.23 billion share repurchases and a $2.25 billion cash decrease, despite $796 million debt reduction.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio improved from 14.08 (2021) to 17.85 (2022) driven by higher operating profits and a $568 million increase in operating cash flow.  <br>- Times Interest Earned ratio rose from 16.79 (2021) to 19.75 (2022) as profitability improvements and cash flow management boosted earnings coverage of interest obligations.  <br>- Leverage remains manageable despite increased Debt-to-Equity, supported by stronger solvency metrics from enhanced operational performance and strategic financing decisions.  <br>- Overall solvency strengthened through improved interest coverage capacity, higher pre-tax profits, and disciplined capital allocation including share repurchases.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) worsened from 113.7 days (2021) to 121.4 days (2022), driven by slower receivables collection (DSO up 53.5 to 54.3 days) and faster supplier payments (DPO down 83.6 to 76.4 days).  <br>- Slower DSO growth reflects extended customer payment timelines, potentially due to revised payment terms, economic conditions, or receivables management inefficiencies.  <br>- Stable inventory management maintained DIO near 143.8 days (2021) vs. 143.5 days (2022), with no material turnover changes.  <br>- Reduced DPO indicates quicker supplier payments, improving cash flow efficiency but diminishing the offsetting effect on CCC.  <br>- Financial statements show increased receivables impacting cash flow despite higher operating cash flow, with payables efficiency efforts noted in disclosures.  <br>- CCC deterioration highlights need to optimize receivables processes to counterbalance accelerated supplier payment practices.

        Caterpillar has demonstrated strong revenue growth, improved efficiency in asset and equity utilization, and manageable debt levels. Despite minor challenges such as slower receivables collection and a slight decline in liquidity, the overall positive trajectory suggests that next year's EPS will increase.
