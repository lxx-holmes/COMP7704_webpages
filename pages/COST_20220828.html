        Risks:  <br>- Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact international operations (27% of net sales, 32% operating income) and increase merchandise costs.  <br>- Natural disasters, pandemics, or extreme weather could disrupt supply chains, operations, and consumer demand, particularly in key markets like California.  <br>- Persistent COVID-19 impacts may affect labor availability, supply chains, consumer behavior, and litigation exposure.  <br>- Climate change-related regulations, energy costs, and commodity volatility could raise compliance costs and reduce gasoline demand.  <br>- Intense retail competition and failure to adapt to omnichannel trends may erode market share and profitability.  <br><br>Opportunities:  <br>- International expansion (260 non-U.S. warehouses) offers growth potential, with 32% of operating income from global markets.  <br>- Membership fee growth (9% YoY to $4.2B) driven by high renewal rates and Executive member penetration enhances recurring revenue.  <br>- E-commerce investments (10% comparable sales growth) aim to meet evolving consumer expectations for digital convenience.  <br>- Private-label Kirkland Signature products improve margins and loyalty, representing a growing sales segment.  <br>- Supply chain and IT infrastructure investments (e.g., depots, digital resiliency) aim to optimize efficiency and mitigate disruption risks.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin increased slightly from 2.55% (2021) to 2.58% (2022) due to net income growth ($5,007M to $5,844M) outpacing revenue growth ($195,929M to $226,954M), reflecting improved expense management.  <br>- Gross profit margin declined from 12.89% (2021) to 12.15% (2022) as merchandise costs surged ($170,684M to $199,382M), likely driven by inflation or supply chain pressures exceeding sales growth.  <br>- Operating profit margin remained stable at ~3.42-3.43% as operating expenses (SG&A rising from $18,537M to $19,779M) grew proportionally with revenue, indicating sustained operational efficiency.  <br>- ROA improved from 8.45% (2021) to 9.11% (2022) as net income growth exceeded asset expansion, signaling enhanced asset utilization.  <br>- ROE rose from 27.69% (2021) to 28.31% (2022) due to net income outpacing equity growth, demonstrating effective equity deployment.  <br>- Return on sales (ROS) increased marginally from 2.60% (2021) to 2.62% (2022), reflecting slightly higher profitability per sales dollar.  <br>- Merchandise cost pressures emerged as a key concern despite overall profitability improvements in net margins, ROA, and ROE.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved slightly from 1.00x (2021) to 1.02x (2022) due to increased accounts payable (up $1.57B), reflecting stable liquidity despite lower cash and higher inventory.  <br>- Quick ratio declined from 0.52x to 0.46x, driven by a $3.69B inventory increase and $1.05B cash decrease, reducing immediate liquidity.  <br>- Cash ratio decreased from 0.38x to 0.32x, primarily due to $842M Taiwan acquisition and $208M dividend payout, lowering cash coverage of liabilities.  <br>- Merchandise inventory rose from $14.22B to $17.91B, tying up cash in less liquid assets and impacting quick ratio negatively.  <br>- Accounts payable increased from $16.28B to $17.85B, indicating extended supplier payment terms which supported the current ratio but not quick/cash ratios.  <br>- Operating cash flow dropped from $8.96B to $7.39B, reducing available cash and contributing to tighter liquidity metrics.  <br>- Costco maintains adequate liquidity overall but requires monitoring of inventory and liquid assets to ensure flexibility.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio decreased from 2.28 (2021) to 2.11 (2022) due to repayment of 2.300% Senior Notes in December 2021 and a reduction in long-term debt fair value from $7,692M to $6,033M.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio improved from 39.23 (2021) to 49.33 (2022), driven by operating income growth from $6,708M to $7,793M and stable interest expenses.  <br>- High Interest Coverage ratios (49.33 in 2022, 39.23 in 2021) reflect robust earnings capacity to meet interest obligations.  <br>- Strategic debt reduction efforts, including balanced debt structure management, contributed to improved solvency metrics.  <br>- Operating income growth and disciplined debt repayment practices underscore enhanced financial stability and solvency position.  <br>- Reduction in long-term debt levels alongside sustained operational performance signals effective financial management and risk mitigation.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO increased from 3.36 days (2021) to 3.60 days (2022), attributed to slower customer collections or sales outpacing receivable management efficiency.  <br>- DIO rose from 30.37 days (2021) to 32.83 days (2022) due to higher inventory levels, potentially from overstocking or misjudged consumer demand.  <br>- DPO decreased from 34.80 days (2021) to 32.68 days (2022), reflecting faster supplier payments possibly to strengthen relationships or manage tighter cash reserves.  <br>- CCC shifted from -1.07 days (2021) to 3.75 days (2022), driven by slower inventory turnover and receivables collection, partially offset by reduced payment terms.  <br>- Costco‚Äôs CCC remains low overall, but the positive shift signals slightly reduced cash conversion efficiency compared to 2021‚Äôs negative cycle.  <br>- Inventory management risks highlighted, including potential markdowns from excess stock and reliance on U.S./Canadian markets for 85% of net sales.  <br>- Faster DPO payments reduced cash reserves, while increased DSO and DIO suggest a need for tighter receivables and inventory controls to maintain cash flow.  <br>- Operational disruptions in core markets (U.S./Canada) could materially impact financial performance due to geographic revenue concentration.
