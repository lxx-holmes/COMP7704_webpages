          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin improved slightly from 2.58% (2022) to 2.6% (2023) due to increased net sales ($222,730M to $237,710M) and net income ($5,844M to $6,292M), reflecting better cost management and operational efficiency.  <br>- Operating profit margin decreased from 3.43% to 3.35% as merchandise costs rose ($199,382M to $212,586M) and SG&A expenses increased ($19,779M to $21,590M), outpacing revenue growth.  <br>- Gross profit margin improved from 12.1% to 12.3% due to merchandise cost increases being offset by higher net sales growth.  <br>- ROA remained stable at 9.12% (2023) vs. 9.11% (2022), indicating proportional growth in net income and total assets.  <br>- ROE declined from 28.31% to 25.13% due to $452M in cash dividends declared in 2023, increasing equity without proportional net income growth.  <br>- Stability across most ratios reflects effective financial management despite minor fluctuations from operating cost pressures and equity changes.
