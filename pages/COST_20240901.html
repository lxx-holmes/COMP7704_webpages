        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin improved from 2.596% (2023) to 2.89% (2024) due to enhanced cost management and operational efficiency, including logistics system optimizations.  <br>- Gross profit margin increased slightly from 12.26% to 12.6%, reflecting better merchandise cost control through direct supplier purchases and depot routing strategies.  <br>- Operating profit margin rose from 3.35% to 3.65%, driven by reduced handling/distribution costs and resource efficiency improvements.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) increased from 9.13% to 10.55%, indicating improved asset utilization through higher sales per dollar of assets and inventory turnover optimization.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) surged from 25.12% to 31.16%, attributed to $700 million in share repurchases and effective reinvestment of retained earnings.  <br>- Asset turnover ratio improved from 3.513 to 3.646, reflecting efficient inventory management and revenue generation per asset unit.  <br>- Total revenue growth across U.S., Canada, and international segments (Note 11) combined with margin expansion boosted overall profitability.  <br>- High sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover from Costco's low-price, limited-selection business model supported profitability gains.  <br>- All profitability ratios showed year-over-year improvement, signaling comprehensive operational efficiency and strategic financial management.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio decreased from 1.068 (2023) to 0.966 (2024) as current liabilities growth ($33.6B to $35.5B) outpaced current assets ($35.9B to $34.2B), indicating minor liquidity decline.  <br>- Quick ratio fell from 0.573 to 0.439 due to reduced cash reserves and increased liabilities, reflecting weaker liquidity without inventory reliance.  <br>- Cash ratio declined from 0.453 to 0.314, driven by $13.7B to $9.9B cash reduction from $9.0B dividends, $700M stock buybacks, and $1.0B debt repayment.  <br>- Current liabilities increased by $1.9B (2023-2024), primarily from higher accounts payable and other liabilities, straining liquidity despite inventory growth.  <br>- Cash reserves dropped $3.8B year-over-year due to aggressive shareholder returns ($9.7B total) and $1.0B Senior Notes repayment in May 2024.  <br>- Operating cash flow of $11.3B was offset by $10.7B financing outflows and capital expenditures, reducing liquid asset buffers.  <br>- Liquidity ratios weakened across all metrics, signaling tighter short-term flexibility, though positions remain near manageable thresholds.  <br>- Merchandise inventories grew but were excluded from quick/cash ratios, limiting their positive impact on overall liquidity assessment.  <br>- Company should monitor cash management and liability growth to avoid strain from debt obligations and shareholder distribution commitments.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased from 1.75 (2023: $43,936M liabilities / $25,058M equity) to 1.95 (2024: $46,209M liabilities / $23,622M equity), driven by $2,273M higher liabilities (including $500M from new Japanese Senior Notes) and $1,436M equity reduction from retained earnings usage.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio improved from 53.0 ($8,487M EBIT / $160M interest) to 57.6 ($9,740M EBIT / $169M interest) due to stronger EBIT growth (+14.8%) outpacing interest expense rise (+5.6%).  <br>- Total liabilities rose partly from long-term debt increases, despite 2024 debt repayments, while equity declined due to operational use of retained earnings.  <br>- Higher leverage reflects increased financial risk but remains manageable given Costco‚Äôs robust earnings expansion, which supports debt servicing capacity.

          - DSO increased from 3.51 days (2023) to 3.97 days (2024), indicating slower receivables collections, likely influenced by changes in payment terms or customer behavior.  <br>- DIO rose from 28.6 days (2023) to 30.6 days (2024), reflecting slower inventory turnover due to supply chain diversification efforts and expanded private-label manufacturing.  <br>- DPO increased from 30.0 days (2023) to 31.9 days (2024), showing extended supplier payment timelines, attributed to negotiated terms that improved cash flow management.  <br>- CCC improved slightly from 2.11 days (2023) to 2.68 days (2024), driven by the larger DPO increase offsetting DSO/DIO impacts, enhancing cash conversion efficiency despite inventory and receivables challenges.  <br>- Strategies like supply chain resilience initiatives and supplier negotiations align with these metric shifts, though continued monitoring of receivables and inventory turnover is recommended.

        Costco has shown consistent growth in revenue, operating income, net income, and EPS over the past three years. The company's efficient management of operations, despite a slight increase in debt, is supported by improved interest coverage and a better cash conversion cycle. These factors suggest that Costco's EPS will continue to grow next year.
