          - Gains on strategic investments, net decreased from 10.21% to 4.57% of total revenue (2021-2022), a -5.64% change  <br>- Benefit from income taxes shifted from +7.11% to -0.33% of revenue (-7.44% change), moving from tax benefit to provision  <br>- Net income declined from 19.18% to 5.45% of revenue (-13.73% change) with 64.6% YoY dollar value decrease  <br>- Total revenue grew 24.7% YoY alongside 23.1% gross profit growth and 20.4% operating income increase  <br>- Total current assets decreased from 33.00% to 24.02% of total assets (-8.98% change), indicating reduced liquidity  <br>- Goodwill increased from 39.71% to 50.37% of total assets (+10.66% change), signaling acquisition-driven asset growth  <br>- Noncurrent debt rose from 4.03% to 11.13% of total liabilities & equity (+7.10% change)  <br>- Total assets grew 43.6% ($66,301 to $95,209) while liabilities increased 49.6% ($24,808 to $37,078)  <br>- Shareholders' equity expanded 40.1% ($41,493 to $58,131) despite faster liability growth than equity

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin declined from 19.2% (2021) to 5.4% (2022) due to Slack acquisition integration costs ($0.7B advertising expense in 2020 rising to $1.0B in 2022) and higher operational expenses.  <br>- Gross profit margin decreased slightly from 74.6% (2021) to 73.6% (2022), reflecting revenue recognition complexity from multi-obligation contracts and rising costs.  <br>- Operating profit margin remained stable at 2.1% (2022 vs. 2021), indicating consistent expense management despite overall cost pressures.  <br>- ROA dropped from 6.1% (2021) to 1.5% (2022), and ROE fell from 9.8% to 2.5%, driven by lower net income and $2.3B in 2022 capitalized contract costs (up from $1.1B in 2020) being amortized over time.  <br>- Revenue growth was offset by disproportionate expense increases, including $2.3B in capitalized costs for obtaining revenue contracts and acquisition-related operational inefficiencies.  <br>- Profitability challenges stem from upfront costs of large acquisitions, rising advertising expenses, and complex revenue allocation processes requiring improved cost controls.

      <section class="horizontal-section" id="liquidity-analysis">
        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 1.23 (2021) to 1.05 (2022) as current liabilities grew from $17.7B to $21.8B, driven by accounts payable, accrued expenses, and a $2.6B increase in unearned revenue from subscription prepayments.  <br>- Quick ratio dropped from 1.11 to 0.93, indicating reduced ability to cover obligations without inventory liquidation; cash ratio fell from 0.35 to 0.25 due to cash reserves decreasing from $6.2B to $5.5B, partially from Slack's $14.9B acquisition.  <br>- Cash outflows for acquisitions (e.g., Slack) and reliance on less-liquid marketable securities contributed to lower cash ratios, though accounts receivable and securities remained stable.  <br>- Unearned revenue growth ($2.6B in 2022) reflects subscription-model strength but increases current liabilities, temporarily pressuring liquidity despite future revenue assurance.  <br>- Rising goodwill/intangible assets from acquisitions added long-term value but strained short-term liquidity via integration costs and liability increases.  <br>- Current ratio staying above 1 confirms solvency, but management must balance liability growth and cash reserves to maintain financial flexibility.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio increased from 0.598 (2021) to 0.637 (2022) due to $8 billion senior unsecured notes issuance in July 2021, with total liabilities rising 49.5% ($12.27B) outpacing 40.1% equity growth.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio declined sharply from 7.109x (2021) to 2.41x (2022) as net income dropped from $4,072M to $1,444M and interest expenses doubled from $96M to $198M.  <br>- Solvency Ratio (Total Liabilities/Equity) rose from 0.598 to 0.637 despite $16.64B equity growth, as $12.27B liability increase altered the debt-equity proportion.  <br>- Total liabilities surged $12.27B (49.5%) to $37,078M in 2022, primarily driven by noncurrent debt increases from the $8B bond issuance.  <br>- Equity grew $16.64B (40.1%) to $58,131M in 2022, partially offsetting leverage but insufficient to prevent higher solvency ratios.  <br>- Contractual interest expense increased 106% YoY to $198M in 2022, exacerbating profitability challenges amid declining net income.  <br>- While solvency remains stable, management must prioritize debt level monitoring and profitability improvement to mitigate rising leverage risks.

      <section class="horizontal-section" id="efficiency-analysis">
        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO increased from 131 days (2021) to 134 days (2022), indicating slower accounts receivable collections, potentially due to billing complexities or economic conditions (Note 1: Revenue Recognition Policies).  <br>- DPO decreased from 290 days (2021) to 284 days (2022), reflecting faster supplier payments linked to working capital optimization efforts (Note 4: Cash Flow Statements).  <br>- Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) shifted from -159 days (2021) to -150 days (2022), showing reduced efficiency despite maintaining a negative cycle where receivables are collected faster than payables are settled.  <br>- The narrowing CCC gap (-150 vs. -159 days) underscores the combined impact of slower collections and accelerated supplier payments, requiring ongoing monitoring to preserve cash flow efficiency (Note 12: Efficiency Ratios).  <br>- Inventory data (DIO) was excluded from CCC calculations, likely due to the company‚Äôs service-based operations lacking significant inventory holdings.  <br>- Operating cash flow improvements (Note 4) partially offset efficiency declines, highlighting proactive working capital management amid minor deteriorations in DSO and DPO metrics.

        Despite strong revenue growth, Salesforce's net income and profitability metrics such as net profit margin, ROA, and ROE have declined significantly. Increased operating expenses, higher debt levels, and rising interest expenses are contributing factors. These elements suggest that EPS may decrease next year as the company manages its investments and debt.
