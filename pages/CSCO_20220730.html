        <!-- Your text goes here. -->
        **Risks:**  <br>- Ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacts supply chains, causing component shortages, extended lead times, and elevated costs.  <br>- Geopolitical instability (e.g., Russia-Ukraine war, China-Taiwan tensions) and economic challenges like inflation disrupt markets.  <br>- Revenue unpredictability due to nonlinear sales patterns, customer spending volatility, and macroeconomic uncertainties.  <br>- Acquisitions risk integration complexities, financial burdens, and potential failure to meet performance targets.  <br>- Cybersecurity threats, data breaches, or product vulnerabilities could harm reputation and operational continuity.  <br><br>**Opportunities:**  <br>- Growth in software and subscription services drives recurring revenue and enhances customer stickiness.  <br>- Expansion into emerging markets capitalizes on rising IT infrastructure investments and digital transformation.  <br>- Rising demand for cybersecurity solutions positions Cisco to address increasing global cyberattack risks.  <br>- Cloud migration and hybrid cloud adoption create demand for network infrastructure and cloud-based services.  <br>- Hybrid work trends boost need for collaboration tools, network security, and scalable connectivity solutions.

          - Total revenue increased 3.5% ($49,818 to $51,557) with gross profit up 1.1% ($31,894 to $32,248), while income from operations rose 8.85% ($12,833 to $13,969) and net income grew 11.53% ($10,591 to $11,812), exceeding 10% as the most notable change  <br>- No material shifts (>¬±5%) in percentage of total revenue composition or balance sheet allocations (assets/liabilities/equity percentages) between years  <br>- Total assets decreased 3.5% ($97,497 to $94,002) alongside liabilities declining 3.5% ($56,222 to $54,229) and shareholders' equity dropping 3.6% ($41,275 to $39,773)  <br>- All balance sheet year-over-year changes remained within ¬±10% thresholds, indicating stable financial structure despite minor reductions in asset/liability/equity totals

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross margin declined from 64.0% (2021) to 62.5% (2022) due to $1.5B increase in product cost of sales, unfavorable product mix, and productivity issues in the Americas segment.  <br>- Operating profit margin improved from 25.7% to 27.1% driven by reduced sales/marketing expenses and restructuring charges dropping from $886M to $6M.  <br>- Net profit margin increased from 21.2% to 22.9% as lower restructuring costs and expense controls offset gross margin pressures.  <br>- ROA rose from 10.8% to 12.5% and ROE from 25.6% to 29.7%, reflecting improved net income and more efficient asset/equity utilization.  <br>- Product revenue grew 6% while service revenue declined 2%, creating cost absorption challenges partially mitigated by operational efficiency gains.  <br>- Profitability improvements occurred despite gross margin headwinds, primarily through disciplined cost management and resolution of prior restructuring programs.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio decreased to 1.43 (2022) from 1.49 (2021), reflecting reduced short-term coverage capacity but remaining stable above 1, partially due to $1.0B inventory increase from Russia-Ukraine war/COVID-19 supply chain disruptions.  <br>- Quick ratio declined to 1.33 (2022) from 1.43 (2021), impacted by lower liquid assets and higher inventory levels, though still above 1 indicating manageable liquidity.  <br>- Cash ratio dropped to 0.75 (2022) from 0.93 (2021) due to $2.1B reduction in cash equivalents and $3.2B decline in investments, raising concerns about immediate liquidity without asset sales.  <br>- Working capital fell to $11,077M (2022) from $12,855M (2021), driven by reduced free cash flow ($12.7B vs. $14.8B) and significant cash outflows including $7.7B stock repurchases and $6.2B dividends.  <br>- Liquidity pressures intensified from $13.9B shareholder returns and acquisitions, but overall stability persists with current/quick ratios above 1, requiring closer cash management monitoring moving forward.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio remained stable at 1.36 in both 2021 ($56,222M liabilities / $41,275M equity) and 2022 ($54,229M liabilities / $39,773M equity), reflecting proportional declines in liabilities and equity.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio improved from 29.6 (2021 EBIT $12,833M / interest $434M) to 38.8 (2022 EBIT $13,969M / interest $360M) due to higher earnings and lower interest costs.  <br>- Solvency Ratio (Total Liabilities/Equity) held steady at 1.36 both years, indicating consistent long-term financial health and leverage management.  <br>- Revenue growth ($51,557M in 2022 vs. $49,818M in 2021) and reduced restructuring charges ($6M vs. $886M) boosted operating income, supporting EBIT expansion.  <br>- Effective financial management maintained ratio stability despite $2B liabilities reduction and $1.5B equity decline between 2021-2022.  <br>- Lower interest expenses (-17% YoY) combined with higher EBIT (+9% YoY) enhanced interest coverage capacity.  <br>- Stable leverage profile demonstrates controlled financial risk despite active balance sheet adjustments.

          - DSO increased to 46.8 days in 2022 (vs. 42.2 in 2021) due to COVID-19-related customer payment delays and extended collection terms.  <br>- DIO rose sharply to 48.5 days (vs. 31.8 in 2021) from supply chain disruptions causing inventory hoarding and logistics delays to mitigate component shortages.  <br>- DPO decreased to 43.1 days (vs. 48.1 in 2021) as Cisco prioritized faster supplier payments to secure inventory amid supply constraints, straining cash reserves.  <br>- Cash Conversion Cycle worsened by 25.3 days to 52.2 in 2022, reflecting combined inefficiencies from slower receivables, prolonged inventory turnover, and accelerated payables.  <br>- Pandemic impacts reduced customer order predictability, increased collection risks, and created nonlinear sales patterns affecting inventory management.  <br>- Supply chain challenges led to 41% inventory value increase (per financial notes) to prevent stockouts, despite higher holding costs.  <br>- Recommendations include optimizing AR collections, improving inventory turnover through demand forecasting, and balancing supplier payment terms with cash flow needs.  <br>- Financial statements cite COVID-19 as primary driver of extended lead times, 15%+ supply chain cost increases, and $2B inventory commitment growth.

        Cisco's financial statements show increasing revenues, improving net margins, and effective expense management, which are positive indicators for future earnings growth. Despite challenges in inventory management and a slight decline in gross margin, the company's overall profitability trends suggest that EPS will increase next year.
