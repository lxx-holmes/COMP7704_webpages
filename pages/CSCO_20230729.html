          - Total revenue increased by 10.55% ($51,557 to $56,998) and gross profit grew 10.88% ($32,248 to $35,753), with no line items showing revenue percentage changes exceeding ¬±5%.  <br>- Cash and cash equivalents rose from 7.55% to 9.97% of total assets, while investments increased from 12.96% to 15.78%.  <br>- Accounts receivable, net declined from 7.03% to 5.78% of total assets; inventories increased from 2.73% to 3.59%.  <br>- Current and non-current financing receivables decreased (4.15% to 3.30% and 4.27% to 3.42%, respectively).  <br>- Short-term debt increased from 1.17% to 1.70% of total liabilities & equity, and income taxes payable (current) surged from 1.02% to 4.18%.  <br>- Long-term debt decreased from 8.93% to 6.58% of total liabilities & equity.  <br>- Retained earnings improved from -1.40% to 1.39% of total liabilities & equity; accumulated other comprehensive loss narrowed from -1.72% to -1.57%.  <br>- Total assets grew 8.3% ($94,002 to $101,852), total liabilities rose 5.9% ($54,229 to $57,499), and shareholders' equity increased 11.4% ($39,773 to $44,353).  <br>- Deferred revenue (current) increased slightly from 13.54% to 13.90% of total liabilities & equity.  <br>- Common stock and additional paid-in capital saw a marginal decline from 45.31% to 44.89% of total liabilities & equity.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross Margin Ratio improved slightly to 62.7% (2022: 62.5%) due to better production/service cost control.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin declined to 26.3% (2022: 27.1%) driven by higher R&D (+$777M) and Sales/Marketing (+$795M) expenses.  <br>- Net Profit Margin decreased to 22.1% (2022: 22.9%) primarily from a $248M loss in Other Income vs. $392M gain in 2022.  <br>- ROA declined marginally to 12.4% (2022: 12.5%) as asset growth (+$7.85B) slightly outpaced net income growth (+$801M).  <br>- ROE fell to 28.4% (2022: 29.7%) due to equity increasing $4.58B while net income rose only $801M.  <br>- Mixed profitability trends: Improved cost control in COGS contrasts with operational inefficiencies and non-operating losses.  <br>- Declining ROA/ROE signals reduced asset/equity efficiency despite higher absolute net income.  <br>- Key challenges include managing operating expenses (particularly R&D/Sales) and optimizing asset utilization for profitability recovery.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current Ratio decreased from 1.43 (2022) to 1.38 (2023), driven by a surge in income taxes payable ($961M to $4,235M) and short-term debt ($1,099M to $1,733M), which outpaced current asset growth.  <br>- Quick Ratio declined from 1.33 to 1.27 as liquid assets (excluding inventory) growth lagged liability increases; cash allocated to dividends and share buybacks reduced liquidity buffer despite inventory rising.  <br>- Cash Ratio improved from 0.75 to 0.83 due to increased cash reserves, though higher current liabilities partially offset this gain.  <br>- Despite declines, Current and Quick Ratios remain above 1, indicating adequate short-term liquidity; Cash Ratio improvement reflects enhanced cash availability.  <br>- Overall liquidity is stable but pressured by rapid liability growth (taxes, debt), requiring monitoring despite strong cash flow allocations to strategic uses.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio decreased from 1.36 (2022) to 1.30 (2023) due to reduced long-term debt ($9.0B to $8.5B) and increased equity ($39.8B to $44.4B), indicating lower debt reliance and improved equity positioning.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio declined slightly from 38.85 to 35.18 as interest expense rose from $360M to $427M, likely due to higher interest rates or new debt issuances, though coverage remains strong.  <br>- Debt-to-Asset Ratio improved from 58% to 56% driven by total asset growth ($94.0B to $101.9B) and reduced long-term debt, reflecting healthier asset financing with less debt dependency.  <br>- Long-term Debt to Capitalization Ratio fell from 17% to 13% as long-term debt decreased and equity increased, signaling a safer capital structure with reduced financial risk.  <br>- Solvency improvements reflect strategic debt reduction and equity strengthening, with robust overall metrics despite minor interest coverage softening, supported by a conservative capital structure approach.

          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) increased from 52.2 days (2022) to 60.5 days (2023), driven by inventory management challenges outweighing receivables/payables improvements.  <br>- DSO improved from 46.8 to 37.5 days due to 12% lower accounts receivable from timing/amount of 2023 billings.  <br>- DIO worsened from 48.5 to 62.7 days as inventory surged 42% to address supply constraints, extending turnover despite easing shortages.  <br>- DPO decreased from 43.1 to 39.7 days, reflecting faster supplier payments through optimized inventory commitments and relationship management.  <br>- Higher CCC signals inventory efficiency as a priority area, requiring attention to balance supply chain resilience with cash flow optimization.

        The company's steady revenue growth, improving gross margins, strong cash position, and effective debt management are positive indicators. Despite increases in operating expenses and a slight decline in profit margins, the overall trend suggests that the company is well-positioned for EPS growth next year, especially if it continues to manage costs effectively and leverage its strong financial position.
