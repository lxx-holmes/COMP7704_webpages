          - Operating expenses increased by 5.8% as a percentage of total revenue.  <br>- Total revenue decreased by 5.6% year-over-year.  <br>- Income from operations decreased by 19% year-over-year.  <br>- Net income decreased by 18.2% year-over-year.  <br>- Cash and cash equivalents decreased from 10% to 6% of total assets.  <br>- Investments decreased from 16% to 8% of total assets.  <br>- Total current assets decreased from 43% to 30% of total assets.  <br>- Goodwill increased from 38% to 47% of total assets.  <br>- Purchased intangible assets increased from 2% to 9% of total assets.  <br>- Short-term debt increased from 2% to 9% of total liabilities and equity.  <br>- Income taxes payable decreased from 4% to 1% of total liabilities and equity.  <br>- Total liabilities increased from 57% to 63% of total liabilities and equity.  <br>- Equity decreased from 44% to 36% of total liabilities and equity.  <br>- Total assets increased by 22% year-over-year.  <br>- Total liabilities increased by 37% year-over-year.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross Margin Ratio increased from 62.7% (2023) to 64.7% (2024) due to improved production/service efficiency.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin declined from 26.3% to 22.6%, driven by rising R&D and sales/marketing expenses outpacing revenue growth.  <br>- Net Profit Margin fell from 22.1% to 19.2% due to higher interest expenses from increased debt and potential tax impacts.  <br>- ROA dropped from 12.4% to 8.3%, reflecting less efficient asset utilization exacerbated by a 6% total revenue decline (product revenue down 9%, services up 5%).  <br>- ROE decreased from 28.4% to 22.7%, signaling reduced equity efficiency linked to $1.4B Splunk acquisition-related intangible asset growth and delayed returns.  <br>- Total assets grew significantly, particularly intangibles from Splunk acquisition, reducing asset productivity despite partial revenue contribution ($1.4B).  <br>- Leverage increased due to acquisition-related debt, raising interest costs and pressuring net income.  <br>- Macroeconomic factors and reduced IT spending further impacted revenue performance alongside acquisition integration challenges.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 1.385 (2023) to 0.908 (2024) due to short-term debt surge from $1,733M to $11,341M, indicating potential liquidity challenges with liabilities exceeding assets.  <br>- Quick ratio fell from 1.269 to 0.825 as cash and investments dropped from $26,146M to $17,854M, worsened by Splunk acquisition reducing liquid assets.  <br>- Cash ratio decreased from 0.835 to 0.440, reflecting reduced cash availability despite increased restricted cash, limiting immediate debt coverage.  <br>- Liquidity deterioration across all ratios signals cash flow challenges, necessitating attention to short-term obligations.  <br>- Acquisition of Splunk in 2024 contributed to cash reserve depletion, exacerbating the decline in cash ratios.  <br>- Restricted cash growth failed to offset overall liquidity decline, maintaining pressure on short-term financial flexibility.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio rose from 1.30 (2023) to 1.74 (2024) due to $13.5B long-term debt issuance and short-term debt surge ($1.7B to $11.3B), with equity remaining relatively stable ($44.4B to $45.5B).  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio declined sharply from 35.86 to 12.16 as interest expense jumped from $427M to $1,006M (higher debt/rates) while EBIT decreased from $15.3B to $12.2B.  <br>- Long-term Debt-to-Equity ratio increased from 0.15 to 0.43 primarily due to $13.5B senior notes issued in February 2024, with minimal equity growth.  <br>- Financial Leverage ratio rose from 2.30 to 2.74 as total assets grew to $124.4B (from $101.9B) through debt financing, outpacing equity growth ($44.4B to $45.5B).  <br>- Short-term debt financing expanded via commercial paper ($10.85B in 2024 vs. none in 2023), supplemented by a $5.0B undrawn credit facility, increasing potential future debt obligations.

        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO increased by 7.9 days to 45.4 days (2024), driven by slower receivables collection due to supply chain disruptions, extended customer payment terms, and potential AR management challenges.  <br>- DIO rose slightly by 2.3 days to 64.9 days (2024), reflecting inventory buildup from component shortages and manufacturing delays, leading to slower turnover despite efforts to secure long-term supply agreements.  <br>- DPO increased by 4.6 days to 44.3 days (2024), a positive trend attributed to negotiated supplier payment term extensions, improving short-term cash flow amid supply chain risks.  <br>- CCC lengthened by 5.6 days to 66 days (2024), as DSO/DIO increases outweighed DPO gains, signaling reduced cash flow efficiency tied to working capital strains from inventory accumulation and delayed collections.  <br>- Supply chain disruptions (component shortages, manufacturing capacity issues) drove higher inventory purchases and order fulfillment delays, exacerbating receivables and inventory management challenges.  <br>- While Cisco increased inventory buffers and supplier commitments to mitigate risks, excess/obsolete inventory risks and prolonged cash conversion cycles persist, highlighting operational inefficiencies.

        Cisco's financial performance indicates a decline in profitability with decreased revenue, increased operating expenses, higher debt levels, and worsened liquidity and solvency positions. These factors suggest that earnings per share will likely decrease next year.
