        Risks:<br>- Continued COVID-19 impacts may strain suppliers, logistics, and demand recovery, creating operational and financial uncertainty.<br>- Crude oil price volatility driven by OPEC actions, geopolitical risks, and energy transition policies threatens earnings and liquidity.<br>- Rising environmental regulations and climate policies could increase compliance costs and accelerate asset impairments.<br>- $12.8 billion in asset retirement obligations may pressure finances if cleanup costs exceed estimates or regulations tighten.<br>- Debt ratio increased to 18.4% in 2021, risking higher financing costs and reduced capital market access during downturns.<br><br>Opportunities:<br>- $800 million allocated to lower-carbon initiatives in 2022 positions Chevron to benefit from energy transition trends.<br>- Higher 2021 oil prices drove $15.6B net income; sustained prices could fund dividends and $18.2B remaining buyback capacity.<br>- $3B Permian Basin development investment targets shale growth, leveraging improved 2021 upstream earnings ($15.8B vs 2020's $2.4B loss).<br>- Noble Energy acquisition adds reserves and production capabilities, enabling portfolio optimization and synergies.<br>- Major projects like Tengiz Field expansion (Kazakhstan) and $1.5B exploration budget support long-term production growth.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin improved from -5.87% (2020) to 10.03% (2021) due to economic recovery boosting revenues to $155.6B (+65% YoY) and elimination of $4.8B impairment charges from 2020.  <br>- Return on Assets rose from -2.31% to 6.53%, reflecting higher asset utilization and operational efficiency as costs grew slower than revenues despite increased crude oil expenses.  <br>- Return on Equity increased from -4.18% to 11.16%, driven by $785M after-tax asset sale gains ($755M upstream) and stable operational expenses amid revenue growth.  <br>- Return on Capital Employed improved from -2.8% to 9.4%, supported by reduced Asset Retirement Obligations ($12.8B in 2021 vs. $13.6B in 2020) and better capital allocation.  <br>- Return on Stockholders' Equity rose from -4.0% to 11.5%, aided by $5.95B tax expense reflecting higher pre-tax profits vs. a $1.89B tax benefit in 2020 during losses.  <br>- Revenue recovery post-pandemic and cost discipline offset rising crude/product costs ($89.4B in 2021 vs. $50.5B in 2020), enabling margin expansion across all profitability metrics.  <br>- Absence of 2020's large-scale upstream asset impairments allowed 2021 net income to benefit fully from improved oil/gas pricing and demand.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current Ratio improved from 1.18 (2020) to 1.26 (2021), driven by increased current assets (including $768 million assets held for sale, Note 11) and reduced capital expenditures (Note 4).  <br>- Quick Ratio rose from 0.92 to 1.02, reflecting higher liquid assets (e.g., receivables) and liability management from capital expenditure reductions and asset sales.  <br>- Cash Ratio declined from 0.25 to 0.21 due to operational cash usage for lease payments (Note 5) and derivative losses (Note 10), despite a slight increase in cash equivalents.  <br>- Lease commitments (Note 5) increased right-of-use assets/liabilities, affecting cash flows and contributing to the lower cash ratio.  <br>- Derivative instruments (Note 10) recorded $1.2 billion in 2021 losses, further impacting cash reserves.  <br>- Overall liquidity strengthened with higher current/quick ratios, but reduced cash ratio signals need to monitor cash reserves against short-term obligations.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio improved from 0.81 (2020) to 0.71 (2021) due to lower total liabilities ($107,064M to $99,595M) and higher equity ($132,726M to $139,940M).  <br>- Financial Leverage Ratio declined from 1.81 to 1.71 as Chevron reduced debt-financed assets, with total assets remaining stable at ~$239.5B.  <br>- Net income swung from -$5,543M (2020) to $15,625M (2021) driven by operational improvements and oil price recovery, significantly boosting equity.  <br>- Long-term debt decreased by $11.7B (2020: $42,767M; 2021: $31,113M), while $7,759M (2021) and $9,825M (2020) of short-term debt were reclassified as long-term via committed credit facilities.  <br>- Total liabilities decreased by $7.5B ($107,064M to $99,595M) alongside a $7.2B equity increase, reflecting debt reduction and strategic capital management.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) improved from 44.3 days (2020) to 43.1 days (2021) due to higher accounts receivable ($7,631M to $12,877M) and better collection practices like stricter payment terms.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) decreased from 21.9 days (2020) to 14.8 days (2021) driven by LIFO inventory valuation, $5,588M excess replacement cost, increased sales, and streamlined supply chain management.  <br>- Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) couldn't be fully calculated due to missing Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) data, but DSO and DIO improvements indicate enhanced cash flow efficiency.  <br>- Asset sales and write-offs, particularly in upstream operations, contributed to inventory reduction and faster turnover, supporting DIO improvement.  <br>- Operational efficiency initiatives, including process optimization and potential supply chain streamlining, further reduced DSO and DIO.

        Chevron's significant turnaround in 2021, with improved net income, revenue growth, and better financial ratios, suggests a positive outlook. The company's efficient management of receivables and inventory, along with reduced debt, positions it well for future growth. While industry risks exist, the current trends indicate that EPS is likely to increase next year.
