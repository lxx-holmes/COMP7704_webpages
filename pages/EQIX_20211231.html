          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin increased from 6.16% (2020) to 7.54% (2021) due to improved cost management and revenue growth, supported by net income rising from $370M to $500M.  <br>- Gross profit margin declined slightly from 48.7% to 47.3% as cost of revenues grew faster than sales (costs up $3.07B to $3.47B vs. revenue growth).  <br>- Operating profit margin decreased from 17.5% to 16.7% due to rising operating expenses (up $4.95B to $5.53B), particularly in sales/marketing ($718M to $741M) and administrative costs ($1.09B to $1.30B).  <br>- ROA improved from 1.37% to 1.79% as net income growth (+35%) outpaced asset growth ($27.0B to $27.9B), indicating better asset utilization.  <br>- ROE rose from 3.47% to 4.60% driven by higher net income ($369.8M to $500.2M) while maintaining stable equity, enhancing shareholder returns.  <br>- Dividend payout ratio decreased from 1131% to 209.1% but remained extremely high, with accumulated dividends rising from $5.1B to $6.2B, signaling aggressive capital return impacting reinvestment capacity.

          - Current ratio improved from 1.29 (2020) to 1.84 (2021) as current assets grew by $347.95B (from $2,609,155M to $2,957,101M) and current liabilities decreased by $418.8B (from $2,024,750M to $1,605,954M).  <br>- Quick ratio rose from 1.13 to 1.38, reflecting stronger liquidity excluding inventory, driven by higher cash reserves and accounts receivable.  <br>- Cash ratio increased from 0.79 to 0.96, supported by $413,765M in net financing cash flows, enhancing short-term debt coverage capacity.  <br>- Current liabilities reduction included repayment of short-term debts and lease obligations, with $177,349M in derivatives (vs. $11,699M in 2020) mitigating forex volatility.  <br>- Strategic lease term extensions (e.g., SV8, HK3 data centers) reclassified $352M of obligations to non-current liabilities, improving liquidity ratios.  <br>- Operational flexibility strengthened through improved cash management, asset growth, and liability restructuring, reinforcing short-term financial health.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased slightly from 1.54 (2020) to 1.56 (2021) due to $3.88B senior notes issuance and $497.9M stock offering, with debt growth outpacing equity expansion despite $10.88B total equity in 2021.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio improved from 2.59 (2020) to 3.29 (2021) as EBIT grew 5% to $1.11B and interest expenses dropped 17% to $336M, driven by refinancing at lower rates and debt repayment.  <br>- 2021 solvency position remained stable with moderate leverage (56% assets debt-funded) and enhanced interest coverage reflecting operational profitability improvements and strategic debt management.  <br>- 2020 debt structure showed $16.37B liabilities against $10.63B equity, with higher $406M interest costs reducing coverage capacity compared to 2021 performance.  <br>- Equity growth through stock issuances partially offset debt increases, but liability growth of $664K (2020-2021) maintained capital structure equilibrium.  <br>- Debt extinguishment costs noted in financial statements contributed to reduced interest burdens and improved coverage ratios year-over-year.  <br>- Stable leverage (1.54-1.56) indicates controlled risk exposure despite expanded borrowing, supported by 3.29x interest coverage demonstrating sufficient earnings to service $336M annual interest obligations.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved from -61 days (2020) to -53 days (2021), driven by reduced Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) from 97 to 90 days, reflecting shorter supplier payment terms while maintaining efficient working capital management.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increased slightly from 36 to 37 days, indicating marginally slower receivables collection but still reflecting overall efficient collection practices.  <br>- No inventory held (0 Days Inventory Outstanding both years), consistent with Equinix's service-based business model requiring minimal physical stock.  <br>- Reduced DPO contributed to a less negative CCC, balancing improved cash flow from faster supplier payments with continued operational efficiency.  <br>- Prudent investment policies, credit risk mitigation via high-rated securities, and efficient tax management supported strong cash flow and working capital efficiency.  <br>- Negative CCC confirms payables exceed receivables, enabling Equinix to fund operations through supplier credit while maintaining liquidity despite shorter payment terms.

        Equinix has shown strong revenue growth, improved net income, and enhanced profitability margins. The company's effective debt management, better liquidity, and strategic investments in growth areas position it well for continued earnings growth. While there are risks like rising costs and a high dividend payout, the overall positive trends suggest that EPS will increase next year.
