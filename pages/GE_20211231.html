        <!-- Your text goes here. -->
        Risks:  <br>- Catastrophic product failures in complex machinery (jet engines, wind turbines) could cause safety incidents, reputational damage, and financial losses.  <br>- Cybersecurity threats (ransomware, data breaches) risk operational disruptions, intellectual property theft, and non-compliance with evolving privacy laws.  <br>- Supply chain disruptions (semiconductor shortages, inflationary pressures) may delay order fulfillment, increase costs, and reduce profitability.  <br>- High debt levels and liquidity risks could limit financial flexibility, increase funding costs, and trigger credit rating downgrades.  <br>- Legal liabilities from legacy issues (Alstom acquisition, insurance reserves) and regulatory non-compliance may result in fines or operational constraints.  <br><br>Opportunities:  <br>- Energy transition demand (offshore wind turbines, grid modernization) supports growth in Renewable Energy and Power segments.  <br>- Aviation sector recovery post-COVID could boost service revenue and LEAP engine adoption as air travel rebounds.  <br>- Healthcare innovation (digital solutions, BK Medical acquisition) enhances competitiveness in medical imaging and surgical technologies.  <br>- Strategic partnerships (AerCap, Baker Hughes) provide monetization avenues and strengthen market positions in key industries.  <br>- Industrial digitalization and automation trends offer growth in predictive maintenance and connected equipment services.

          - Current ratio declined from 1.55 (2020) to 1.28 (2021), showing reduced current assets relative to liabilities while maintaining ability to cover obligations.  <br>- Quick ratio dropped from 1.26 to 0.97, indicating deteriorating liquidity when excluding inventory and prepaid assets.  <br>- Cash ratio plummeted from 0.67 to 0.30 due to $20.76B decrease in cash reserves ($36.53B to $15.77B), raising immediate payment concerns.  <br>- Current assets fell 22% from $84.85B to $66.35B, reducing short-term resource availability.  <br>- Current liabilities decreased slightly from $54.61B to $51.95B, reflecting minor improvement in obligation management.  <br>- Liquidity strain primarily driven by $15.77B cash position (57% decline) despite stable current ratio above 1.  <br>- Working capital management requires urgent attention to rebuild cash reserves and optimize asset-liability balance.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio improved from 5.91 (2020) to 3.78 (2021) due to reduced debt via asset sales (e.g., GECAS transaction yielding 111.5 million AerCap shares) and $6,524 million debt extinguishment costs, enhancing financial stability.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio turned negative in 2021 from 2.88 in 2020, driven by a $6,757 million net loss from debt extinguishment costs, goodwill impairments, and lower revenues.  <br>- Equity Ratio rose from 14.5% (2020) to 20.9% (2021) due to AerCap equity infusion and reduced total assets ($256,211M to $198,874M) from discontinued operations like GECAS divestment.  <br>- Profitability challenges in 2021 stemmed from higher operational costs, revenue declines, and one-time charges (e.g., $6,524M debt extinguishment), contrasting with 2020‚Äôs $5,230M net earnings.  <br>- Strategic transactions (asset sales, debt reduction) improved debt management and equity positions but failed to offset profitability pressures affecting interest coverage capacity.

          - DSO decreased from 80.2 days (2020) to 76.8 days (2021) due to discontinued factoring programs and improved collections, supported by reduced credit loss allowances (Note 4).  <br>- DIO increased from 100.1 days to 107.4 days, reflecting slower inventory turnover from supply chain disruptions and lower Power segment demand, despite stable inventory levels (~$15.8B in 2021 vs. 2020) (Note 5).  <br>- DPO rose from 103.9 days to 110.0 days through extended supplier terms and increased supply chain finance program usage ($6.9B in 2021 vs. $4.9B in 2020) (Note 4).  <br>- CCC improved to 74.2 days in 2021 from 76.4 days in 2020, driven by receivables/payables efficiency offsetting inventory challenges.  <br>- External factors like COVID-19, energy transition impacts on fossil fuel demand, and macroeconomic conditions influenced inventory and operational dynamics (Note 1).

        Based on the financial statements, GE experienced a significant decline in net income, turning from a profit to a loss between 2020 and 2021. The negative earnings per share (EPS) in 2021, coupled with decreased total revenues and increased costs, indicate ongoing profitability challenges. The company's cash reserves also decreased substantially, which could impact future liquidity. While there were improvements in debt management and working capital, the overall negative trends in profitability and cash flow suggest that EPS is likely to decrease next year without significant operational improvements.
