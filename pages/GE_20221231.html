        Risks:<br>- Separation into smaller entities increases vulnerability to economic volatility, geopolitical risks, and reduced financial diversification, heightening operational instability.<br>- Global exposure (57% non-U.S. revenue) subjects operations to trade conflicts, inflation, supply chain disruptions, and currency fluctuations, pressuring profitability.<br>- Aerospace remains strained by COVID-19‚Äôs lingering impact on air travel demand, customer solvency, and contractual renegotiations.<br>- Complex product failures (e.g., wind turbines, cybersecurity breaches) risk reputational damage, warranty costs, and operational downtime.<br>- Regulatory shifts (climate policies, sanctions) and legacy legal liabilities (e.g., Alstom) escalate compliance costs and litigation risks.<br><br>Opportunities:<br>- Post-separation focus on Aviation, Energy, and Healthcare could enhance strategic agility and market-specific innovation.<br>- Aerospace recovery from rebounding air travel may drive demand for engine services and next-gen technologies like LEAP.<br>- Renewable Energy growth via Haliade-X offshore wind turbines aligns with global clean energy transition trends.<br>- Healthcare spin-off enables dedicated investment in medical tech innovation and expansion in high-demand markets.<br>- Asset sales (e.g., Steam business to EDF) unlock capital for debt reduction and reinvestment in core growth areas.

          - Debt extinguishment costs decreased by 8.19%, with total costs and expenses down 8.89%, driving earnings from continuing operations before taxes (+6.80%) and after taxes (+5.79%) higher.  <br>- Net earnings increased 9.26%, including a 9.07% rise in Company-attributable earnings and 9.02% growth for common shareholders.  <br>- Income from operations declined 127.6% year-over-year, while net income surged 104.4%, reflecting profitability improvements and a net income turnaround.  <br>- Cash/cash equivalents and restricted cash rose from 7.9% to 9.2% of total assets; current receivables increased from 7.8% to 9.6%, and inventories grew from 8.0% to 9.3%.  <br>- Investment securities (non-current) declined from 21.3% to 19.2% of assets, while goodwill decreased marginally from 13.2% to 13.7% and other intangible assets fell from 4.7% to 4.1%.  <br>- Deferred income taxes increased from 5.5% to 6.2% of total assets.  <br>- Total assets decreased 5.6% year-over-year, liabilities dropped 4.5%, and shareholders‚Äô equity declined 9.8%.  <br>- Notable asset growth in cash, receivables, and inventories contrasted with declines in investment securities and intangible assets.  <br>- Liabilities and equity both contracted, with shareholders‚Äô equity experiencing the sharpest reduction (-9.8%).

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin improved from -9.11% (2021) to -0.08% (2022) due to expense management and revenue growth, nearing profitability despite remaining negative.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin remained stable at 27.38% (2021) to 27.47% (2022), reflecting consistent production cost control and COGS efficiency.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin turned positive at 1.84% (2022 vs. -4.96% in 2021) through operational efficiency gains, cost reductions, and restructuring efforts.  <br>- ROA improved from -3.40% (2021) to -0.03% (2022), and ROE from -16.24% to -0.17%, but both stayed negative due to poor asset utilization and high debt.  <br>- Dividend Payout Ratio remained non-meaningful (negative EPS) as GE did not distribute dividends from earnings.  <br>- Operational improvements included restructuring initiatives and cost-cutting measures outlined in MD&A, driving positive operating margins.  <br>- 2023 HealthCare segment spin-off eliminated losses from that division, contributing to enhanced profitability metrics.  <br>- Percentage of completion accounting for long-term contracts aligned revenue recognition with project milestones, stabilizing financial performance.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current Ratio declined from 1.28x (2021) to 1.16x (2022) due to increased current liabilities ($56,947M vs. $51,953M) and marginal current asset decrease ($66,234M vs. $66,348M).  <br>- Quick Ratio decreased from 0.94x to 0.83x as liquid assets (excluding inventories) grew insufficiently to offset $5B liability growth from higher accounts payable and deferred income.  <br>- Cash Ratio remained stable at 0.30x despite liability increases, supported by cash/cash equivalents growth from $15,770M to $17,262M.  <br>- Current liabilities surged 9.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by progress collections and deferred income obligations.  <br>- Marginal 0.17% reduction in current assets amplified liquidity pressure despite improved receivables and contract assets.  <br>- Stable cash reserves demonstrated maintained emergency liquidity, but reliance on non-cash assets increased for routine obligations.  <br>- Inventory levels remained consistent, indicating the Quick Ratio decline stemmed from liability growth rather than stockpiling.  <br>- Working capital management requires enhanced focus as liability growth outpaces liquid asset accumulation.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased from 3.78 (2021) to 4.00 (2022), reflecting higher debt reliance for strategic investments or operational support.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio improved from -0.96 (2021) to 1.88 (2022), driven by increased earnings or reduced interest expenses, indicating enhanced operational efficiency.  <br>- Equity Ratio declined slightly from 20.9% (2021) to 20.0% (2022), signaling greater debt financing of assets compared to equity.  <br>- Negative 2021 Interest Coverage (-0.96) revealed prior challenges covering interest expenses, reversed in 2022 through financial improvements.  <br>- Rising leverage and reduced equity financing align with GE's strategic debt utilization for growth initiatives while achieving better interest expense coverage.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO increased from 39 days (2021) to 43 days (2022), indicating slower receivables collection due to economic challenges, extended customer payment terms, or difficulties with sovereign/emerging market clients.  <br>- DIO rose from 51 days to 55 days, reflecting slower inventory turnover caused by supply chain disruptions (inflation, labor shortages) delaying sales.  <br>- DPO increased from 64 days to 68 days as GE strategically delayed supplier payments to preserve cash flow, though this risks straining supplier relationships.  <br>- CCC lengthened from 26 days (2021) to 30 days (2022) due to combined 4-day increases in DSO, DIO, and DPO, signaling reduced cash flow efficiency from operational and external pressures.  <br>- Slower receivables, inventory bottlenecks, and adjusted payment strategies collectively reduced working capital efficiency despite marginally improved liquidity management.

        General Electric has shown significant improvement in its financial performance, with a substantial reduction in net losses and a near-breakeven net profit margin. The company's operational efficiency has enhanced, as evidenced by a positive operating profit margin and improved interest coverage. While GE has increased its debt, the overall trend suggests a move towards profitability. These factors indicate that GE's EPS is likely to increase next year.
