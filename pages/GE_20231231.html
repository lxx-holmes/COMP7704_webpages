          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin increased from 0.09% (2022) to 13.5% (2023) due to 16.8% revenue growth and reduced debt/separation costs.  <br>- Gross profit margin rose from 23.8% to 25.9%, reflecting improved sales mix and cost management strategies.  <br>- Operating profit margin shifted from -1.4% to 15.0%, driven by operational efficiency gains and higher net earnings ($9,443M vs. $407M).  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) improved from 0.03% to 5.6% through better asset utilization and increased profitability from continuing operations.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) surged from 0.15% to 32.2%, supported by higher earnings retention and effective equity management.  <br>- Dividend payout ratio dropped from 566.7% to 3.2% as earnings growth reduced reliance on dividend distributions.  <br>- GE HealthCare spin-off in 2023 streamlined operations, lowering costs and boosting net earnings from continuing businesses.  <br>- Revenue growth and cost reductions across segments contributed to overall margin expansion and stronger financial health.  <br>- Reduced expenses in debt restructuring and business separations directly enhanced profitability metrics year-over-year.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio remained stable at 1.18x (2022-2023), indicating consistent balance between current assets and short-term liabilities.  <br>- Quick ratio declined slightly from 0.88x to 0.85x, driven by a $1.6 billion inventory increase in 2023 reducing highly liquid asset coverage.  <br>- Cash ratio improved marginally from 0.32x to 0.33x due to cash growth from asset monetization (AerCap shares, GE HealthCare sale) raising total cash to $17.0 billion.  <br>- Stable overall liquidity reflects effective cash management strategies but highlights inventory management risks as less liquid assets grow.  <br>- Inventory accumulation offset gains in liquid assets, requiring closer monitoring to maintain short-term obligation coverage capacity.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased from 4.41 (2022) to 4.70 (2023) due to higher debt levels and reduced equity, including a $5.8B preferred stock redemption and $1.1B share buyback program.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio improved from 0.46x to 10.11x as cash interest payments decreased by $494M (2022: $1,561M; 2023: $1,067M) through lower borrowings and favorable refinancing.  <br>- Debt-to-Asset ratio rose slightly from 81.5% to 82.4% despite total borrowings declining from $24.1B to $21.0B, reflecting relatively stable asset valuations compared to debt levels.  <br>- Long-term Debt to Total Assets ratio increased from 10.76% to 12.09% due to proportional growth in long-term debt financing despite reduced total borrowings.  <br>- Total equity decreased from $34,912M (2022) to $28,579M (2023), driven by capital restructuring activities impacting solvency metrics.  <br>- Lower average borrowings and improved debt terms contributed to reduced interest expenses, enhancing short-term interest payment capacity.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) increased from 89.0 days (2022) to 91.4 days (2023) due to slower supplier payments (DPO decline) offsetting receivables/inventory improvements.  <br>- DSO improved 10 days to 83.1 days (2023) from faster receivables collection, supported by $1.9B higher current receivables from improved billing/collections.  <br>- DIO decreased 3 days to 119.8 days (2023) due to better inventory turnover, with $0.4B inventory increase reflecting optimized material usage despite higher purchases.  <br>- DPO fell 15.4 days to 111.5 days (2023), driven by $2.5B accounts payable reduction from supplier prepayments, extending payment timelines and straining cash flow efficiency.  <br>- Longer CCC suggests trade-off: operational gains in receivables/inventory management countered by delayed supplier payments, potentially impacting supplier relationships.  <br>- Inventory management improvements aligned with streamlined production/forecasting, while receivables progress stemmed from tighter payment terms/collection efforts.  <br>- Slower payables contributed to 2.4-day CCC increase despite DSO/DIO gains, highlighting cash flow prioritization over supplier payment speed.
