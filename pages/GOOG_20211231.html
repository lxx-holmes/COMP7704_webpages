          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin increased from 22.08% (2020) to 29.54% (2021), reflecting improved revenue conversion efficiency driven by higher advertising revenues, operational improvements, and post-COVID-19 recovery.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin rose from 22.58% to 30.57% due to reduced Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC) and disciplined operating expense management.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin grew from 53.58% to 56.97% through enhanced pricing strategies and tighter control of production costs.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) surged from 12.59% to 21.16% as asset utilization improved, partly from extended asset life estimates lowering depreciation expenses.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) jumped from 18.07% to 30.23% due to higher net income and optimized equity deployment.  <br>- Revenue growth in high-margin segments (Google Search, YouTube, Google Cloud) supported profitability gains alongside broader cost management initiatives.  <br>- All profitability metrics showed significant year-over-year improvement, indicating successful execution of operational efficiency and revenue growth strategies post-pandemic.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio decreased from 3.06 (2020) to 2.93 (2021) as current liabilities grew 13% (to $64.3B) versus 8% current asset growth (to $188.1B), driven by higher accrued compensation/expenses.  <br>- Quick ratio declined from 3.05 to 2.91, mirroring current ratio trends due to faster liability growth outpacing liquid asset expansion.  <br>- Cash ratio dropped significantly from 0.466 to 0.326 as cash/cash equivalents fell 21% to $20.9B while liabilities rose, exacerbated by $61.4B share repurchases and $24.6B property/equipment investments.  <br>- Liquidity remained strong overall with $139.6B total cash/securities (up from $136.7B) and unused $10B credit facility, despite ratios decreasing.  <br>- Key drivers included 25% increase in accrued compensation ($13.9B), 13% current liability growth, and strategic cash allocation to capital expenditures/share buybacks.  <br>- Inventory and accounts receivable growth contributed to current asset increases but did not offset liability expansion in ratio calculations.  <br>- Operational expenditures (e.g., operating leases, accrued expenses) and financing activities (share repurchases) reduced immediate cash liquidity while maintaining long-term financial flexibility.

          - Debt-to-Equity ratio decreased from 0.436 (2020) to 0.427 (2021) due to reduced debt reliance (no commercial paper outstanding, stable long-term debt) and $29.1B growth in stockholders' equity.  <br>- Equity ratio increased from 0.696 to 0.700 as equity financing grew ($251.6B total equity in 2021) and assets expanded (property/equipment up $12.9B to $97.6B).  <br>- Net income doubled from $40.3B (2020) to $76.0B (2021), enhancing equity through retained earnings and reducing debt dependency.  <br>- Operating cash flow surged 41% to $91.7B in 2021, decreasing need for external debt financing despite $50.3B spent on share repurchases.  <br>- Conservative debt management maintained stable long-term debt ($14.8B in 2021 vs $13.9B in 2020) with no borrowings from $10B credit facility.  <br>- Revenue growth and profitability improvements strengthened financial stability, allowing increased equity financing of asset investments.

          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved from 41.0 days (2020) to 39.7 days (2021), driven by DSO reduction and DPO decrease, partially offset by DIO increase.  <br>- DSO decreased from 61.9 to 55.7 days due to improved receivables management, supported by accounts receivable growth from $30,930M to $39,304M.  <br>- DIO increased slightly from 3.1 to 3.8 days, reflecting inventory growth from $728M to $1,170M, potentially for strategic stockpiling or demand preparation.  <br>- DPO declined from 24.0 to 19.8 days despite accounts payable increasing from $5,589M to $6,037M, indicating shorter supplier payment terms.  <br>- Faster receivables collection (DSO) had the most significant CCC impact, while minor inventory turnover slowdown (DIO) and accelerated supplier payments (DPO) contributed smaller effects.  <br>- Overall working capital efficiency improved, enhancing liquidity through optimized cash cycle management.
