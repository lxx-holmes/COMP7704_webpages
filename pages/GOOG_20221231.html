          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin declined from 29.57% (2021) to 21.21% (2022) due to 20% operating expense growth outpacing 10% revenue growth, driven by increased R&D, sales/marketing, and administrative costs.  <br>- Operating profit margin decreased from 30.58% to 26.47%, reflecting higher operating costs from workforce expansion and third-party services.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) fell from 21.16% to 16.43% as cost of revenues grew 14% (outpacing revenue), including higher traffic acquisition costs and data center expenses.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) declined from 30.23% to 23.42%, impacted by acquisition costs (Mandiant's $6.1B purchase) and growth investments reducing shareholder returns.  <br>- Gross profit margin slightly decreased from 56.99% to 55.35% due to cost of revenues increasing 14%, particularly in traffic acquisition and content-related expenses.  <br>- Operating expense ratio rose from 26.41% to 28.92% as operating expenses grew faster than revenues across multiple cost categories.  <br>- Mandiant acquisition added $6.1B in costs and integration of 2,600 employees, creating short-term expense pressures.  <br>- Significant investments in AI, cloud infrastructure, and innovation initiatives increased near-term expenditures despite long-term growth potential.  <br>- External factors like geopolitical tensions and foreign exchange fluctuations contributed marginally to performance challenges.  <br>- Cost optimization measures include workforce reductions and office space rationalization to improve future profitability.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 2.93 (2021) to 2.38 (2022) due to $23,348M decrease in current assets (Russia suspension, forex impacts) and $5,046M increase in current liabilities (higher compensation, third-party services, advertising costs).  <br>- Quick ratio decreased from 2.91 to 2.34, reflecting reduced liquidity from lower current assets and rising liabilities.  <br>- Cash ratio remained stable (0.33 to 0.32) despite cash increasing slightly from $20,945M to $21,879M, indicating continued reliance on non-cash assets for short-term obligations.  <br>- Operating cash flow slightly decreased from $91,652M to $91,495M due to higher cost of revenues, operating expenses, and tax payments.  <br>- Investing cash outflows dropped from $35,523M to $20,298M as marketable securities purchases declined, though capital expenditures rose to $31.5B in 2022.  <br>- Financing cash outflows increased from $61,362M to $69,757M, driven by $59.3B in share repurchases reducing cash reserves.  <br>- Mandiant acquisition ($6.1B) and global economic impacts from the Ukraine war contributed to liquidity changes.  <br>- Stock repurchases and operational expense growth underscore need to monitor working capital efficiency despite maintaining overall liquidity.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio improved slightly from 0.427 (2021) to 0.426 (2022), reflecting stable leverage with liabilities at $107,633M vs. $109,120M and equity at $251,635M vs. $256,144M, supported by proportional growth in both.  <br>- Solvency Ratios remained near 0.427 (2021) and 0.426 (2022), indicating liabilities were less than half of equity, ensuring long-term stability.  <br>- Total liabilities increased by $1,487M (2021: $107,633M; 2022: $109,120M), offset by a $4,509M equity rise (2021: $251,635M; 2022: $256,144M), maintaining balanced leverage.  <br>- Strong operating cash flow of $91.5B in 2022 bolstered liquidity and equity growth, reducing reliance on debt financing.  <br>- $59.3B in share repurchases in 2022 reduced equity, but operational earnings growth counterbalanced this, preserving the debt-to-equity ratio.  <br>- Capital management prioritized moderate debt levels, avoiding over-leveraging while funding operations and shareholder returns effectively.  <br>- Stable ratios underscore disciplined financing decisions, with debt and equity expanding in tandem to support financial health.

          - DSO decreased from 54.8 days (2021) to 51.4 days (2022), reflecting improved collections likely from enhanced accounts receivable management.  <br>- DIO doubled from 3.8 days (2021) to 7.6 days (2022), indicating slower inventory turnover potentially due to Mandiant acquisition and strategic inventory buildup for new products.  <br>- DPO declined from 19.8 days (2021) to 14.8 days (2022), suggesting faster supplier payments possibly to conserve cash amid $59.3 billion in share repurchases.  <br>- CCC increased from 38.8 days (2021) to 44.2 days (2022), driven by inventory delays and accelerated payables, compounded by infrastructure/data center investments tying up liquidity.  <br>- Improved DSO partially offset DIO/DPO challenges, but overall cash conversion efficiency declined due to inventory management shifts and cash prioritization for strategic initiatives.  <br>- Mandiant integration and new product preparation likely contributed to inventory turnover delays, while aggressive capital returns influenced supplier payment speed.  <br>- Technical infrastructure expansions and share buybacks created competing cash demands, reducing flexibility in working capital management.

        Based on the analysis of Alphabet Inc.'s financial statements from 2020 to 2022, the company has experienced a decline in net income and earnings per share (EPS) from 2021 to 2022. This decline is attributed to increasing operating expenses, particularly in cost of revenues and research and development, which have outpaced revenue growth. Additionally, the profitability ratios such as net profit margin and operating profit margin have decreased, indicating eroding profitability. While the company maintains a healthy liquidity and solvency position, the current trend suggests that without significant cost management improvements or revenue growth, EPS is likely to decrease next year.
