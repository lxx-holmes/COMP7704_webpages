          - Net Profit Margin increased from 21.2% (2022) to 24.0% (2023) due to 9% revenue growth outpacing 6% cost of revenues increase and 10% operating expense rise, enhancing net income.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin improved from 26.5% to 27.4% through cost control measures, including reduced depreciation from extended server/equipment lives and efficient asset utilization.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) rose from 16.4% to 18.3% driven by better asset utilization and cost management, contributing to higher profitability per asset.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) increased from 23.4% to 26.0% reflecting effective equity use, supported by operational streamlining and workforce cost optimization despite one-time severance charges.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin improved from 55.4% to 56.6% due to controlled cost of revenues and revenue diversification into cloud/subscription services, despite their lower margins.  <br>- Revenue growth to $307.4 billion (9% increase) was driven by Google Services and Cloud, with a 7% rise in paid clicks enhancing monetization.  <br>- Diversification into cloud and subscription services provided revenue stability, balancing lower-margin segments with overall growth.  <br>- Operational efficiency gains included office space optimization and workforce adjustments, streamlining costs despite initial severance expenses.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio decreased from 2.38 (2022) to 2.10 (2023) due to 12.5% rise in current liabilities outpacing 4.1% asset growth (liabilities: $69,300M to $81,814M; assets: $164,795M to $171,530M).  <br>- Cash ratio declined from 0.32 to 0.29 as cash/cash equivalents grew $2,169M (to $24,048M) but were offset by $12,515M liability increase.  <br>- Current liabilities surged partly from accrued expenses rising $8,302M (2022: $37,866M; 2023: $46,168M), including EU fines, equipment accruals, and operational expenses.  <br>- Non-current asset investments increased 19.3% ($112,668M to $134,345M), diverting resources from short-term liquidity while supporting long-term growth.  <br>- Operating cash flow improved 11.2% ($91,495M to $101,746M), strengthening liquidity despite higher investing/financing activities reducing cash ratio impact.  <br>- Total cash/securities remained robust at $110,916M (2023), covering short-term obligations comfortably despite ratio declines.  <br>- Management priorities include monitoring liability growth rates, optimizing cash reserves, and balancing infrastructure investments with liquidity maintenance.  <br>- Liquidity position remains healthy with current assets covering liabilities over 2x, though tighter working capital management is advised for stability.

          - Debt-to-equity ratio decreased from 0.43 (2022) to 0.42 (2023) due to $62.2 billion share repurchases funded by cash reserves ($110.9 billion), avoiding debt increases.  <br>- Equity ratio remained stable at 70.0% (2022) to 70.5% (2023), reflecting consistent equity financing of assets despite share buybacks.  <br>- Interest coverage ratio not calculable due to undisclosed interest expense data.  <br>- Capital expenditures of $32.3 billion (2023) for infrastructure/data centers were financed through cash reserves rather than debt.  <br>- Long-term debt slightly decreased with no short-term commercial paper debt outstanding, demonstrating prudent debt management.  <br>- Stable cash position enabled strategic investments and equity adjustments without compromising financial leverage ratios.
