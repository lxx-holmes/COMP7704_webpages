          - Total revenue increased by 14.4% ($132,110M to $151,157M) with gross profit up 13.3% ($44,853M to $50,832M), operating income up 26.1% ($18,278M to $23,040M), and net income up 27.7% ($12,866M to $16,433M).  <br>- Cash and equivalents fell from 11.18% to 3.26% of total assets, indicating reduced liquidity.  <br>- Merchandise inventories grew from 23.54% to 30.69% of total assets, signaling inventory expansion.  <br>- Short-term debt emerged at 1.41% of total liabilities & equity (up from 0% in 2021), reflecting new borrowing.  <br>- Total stockholders' equity shifted from 4.67% to -2.36%, with a 151.52% YoY decline ($3,299M positive to $1,696M deficit).  <br>- Revenue composition stability observed (no line item changes exceeding ¬±5% between 2020-2021).  <br>- Combined changes reflect liquidity pressure, inventory buildup, debt initiation, and severe equity erosion.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross profit margin declined slightly from 33.9% (2020) to 33.6% (2021) due to higher inventory costs, evidenced by merchandise inventories increasing from $16,627M to $22,068M.  <br>- Operating profit margin improved from 13.8% to 15.2% through better expense management, supported by reduced cash outflows from operating activities.  <br>- Net profit margin increased from 9.7% to 10.9% driven by higher net earnings ($12,866M in 2020 vs. $16,433M in 2021).  <br>- ROA rose significantly from 18.2% to 22.9% as asset utilization improved, with total assets growing modestly ($70,581M to $71,876M) alongside substantial earnings growth.  <br>- ROE turned negative in 2021 due to a stockholders' equity deficit (-$1,696M vs. +$3,299M in 2020), primarily from $14,809M spent on share repurchases.  <br>- Operational efficiency gains were offset by equity structure concerns, requiring attention to debt levels and capital allocation strategies.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 1.23x (2020) to 1.01x (2021) due to reduced cash reserves ($7,895M to $2,343M) and increased current liabilities ($23,166M to $28,693M), signaling weakened short-term debt coverage.  <br>- Quick ratio dropped from 0.51x (2020) to 0.24x (2021) as inventory surged 32.8% ($16,627M to $22,068M), tying up capital in less liquid assets.  <br>- Cash ratio fell sharply from 0.34x (2020) to 0.08x (2021) due to $14.8B share repurchases, $7.0B dividends, and $7.8B HD Supply acquisition depleting cash reserves.  <br>- Working capital strain intensified with 15.6% accounts payable growth ($11,606M to $13,462M) and 14.8% receivables increase ($2,992M to $3,426M), though inventory buildup dominated liquidity pressures.  <br>- Operating cash flow decreased $2.3B year-over-year due to inventory accumulation and higher transportation/product costs, despite improved vendor payment terms.  <br>- Capital expenditures rose to $2.6B (2021 from $2.4B in 2020), compounding cash reserve pressures from strategic investments.  <br>- COVID-19 disruptions caused inventory shrink estimation challenges, with 2020 estimates based on limited physical counts and 2021 resumption of full inventory audits.  <br>- While current ratio remains above 1, reliance on inventory sales to meet obligations raises concerns given supply chain volatility and reduced cash buffers.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio became non-meaningful in 2022 (negative equity) versus 20.4 in 2021, driven by $14.8B share repurchases and $7.0B dividends in 2021 that reduced equity from $3,299M to -$1,696M.  <br>- Interest coverage ratio improved from 13.6x (2021) to 17.1x (2022) due to net earnings increasing from $12,866M to $16,433M.  <br>- Solvency ratio rose above 1 (1.023x in 2022 vs 0.954x in 2021) as liabilities grew to $73,572M (+$6.29B) while assets only increased to $71,876M (+$1.295B), partly from new senior notes and commercial paper borrowings.  <br>- Negative equity and liabilities exceeding assets in 2022 indicate potential financial stress despite improved earnings capacity for interest payments.  <br>- Total debt increased through new issuances while shareholder equity erosion accelerated via capital return programs, creating mixed solvency signals.

          - Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) remained stable at 8.27 days (2021) vs. 8.26 days (2020), indicating consistent accounts receivable management.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) increased significantly from 69.62 days (2020) to 80.16 days (2021), driven by COVID-19 supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and demand forecasting challenges.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) showed minimal change at 49.00 days (2021) vs. 48.55 days (2020), reflecting stable supplier payment practices.  <br>- Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) rose from 29.33 days (2020) to 39.43 days (2021) due to prolonged inventory turnover, with operational inefficiencies from pandemic-related distribution delays and online order surges.  <br>- Supply chain constraints caused inventory stockpiling and restocking delays, while labor shortages at fulfillment centers slowed inventory movement through the supply chain.  <br>- Increased CCC signals reduced liquidity efficiency, as inventory-to-cash conversion slowed despite unchanged receivables collection and payables management.

        Despite strong revenue and net earnings growth, significant concerns such as decreased cash reserves, increased debt, negative equity, and inventory management inefficiencies pose risks. These factors could outweigh the positive earnings trends, leading to a potential decrease in next year's EPS.
