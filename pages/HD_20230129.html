          - Total revenue increased by 4.13% ($151,157M to $157,403M), with gross profit up 3.83% ($50,832M to $52,778M), income from operations up 4.34% ($23,040M to $24,039M), and net income up 4.09% ($16,433M to $17,105M).  <br>- No significant changes (>¬±5%) in percentage of total revenue composition between Fiscal 2022 and 2021 for any line items.  <br>- Retained earnings increased by +6.62 percentage points as a percentage of total equity/liabilities.  <br>- Total current liabilities decreased by -9.68 percentage points as a percentage of total equity/liabilities.  <br>- Total shareholders' equity grew 192% year-over-year, indicating substantial equity expansion.  <br>- No key financial items (revenue, profit, net income) exceeded ¬±10% growth thresholds, suggesting stable operational performance.  <br>- Structural shifts in financial position highlighted by retained earnings growth, reduced current liabilities, and tripled shareholders' equity.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross Profit Margin (GPM) slightly decreased from 33.6% (2021) to 33.5% (2022) due to strategic inventory investments addressing supply chain disruptions, increasing in-stock levels, and preparing for seasonal demand.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin (OPM) remained stable (15.23% to 15.27%) through effective operating expense management despite working capital changes affecting cash flow.  <br>- Net Profit Margin (NPM) stayed consistent at ~10.86%, reflecting controlled non-operational expenses despite minor cost-of-sales increases.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) declined from 22.86% to 22.38% due to less efficient asset utilization from capital expenditures and new supply chain facilities still ramping up productivity.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) improved from -969% to 1095% due to reduced share repurchases ($14.8B to $6.7B), increased net earnings, and higher long-term debt issuance increasing leverage.  <br>- Stable profitability margins reflect disciplined expense control, while ROA challenges stem from ongoing supply chain infrastructure investments.  <br>- ROE improvement signals stronger equity performance but highlights leverage risks from increased debt and aggressive capital structure changes.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved from 1.01 (2021) to 1.40 (2022) due to current assets increasing by $3,416M (including $2,818M inventory growth for supply chain resilience) and current liabilities decreasing by $5,583M (driven by $2,019M accounts payable reduction and $435M accrued salaries decline).  <br>- Quick ratio rose from 0.24 to 0.33 as cash/cash equivalents grew by $1,503M and receivables improved, despite excluding $27,496M in merchandise inventories from liquid assets.  <br>- Cash ratio increased from 0.08 to 0.12 supported by $1,503M cash growth and $5,583M liability reduction, strengthening immediate liquidity.  <br>- Current assets expanded from $29,055M to $32,471M primarily through strategic inventory investments to address supply chain disruptions and maintain in-stock levels.  <br>- Current liabilities decreased from $28,693M to $23,110M through disciplined management of payables and operational accruals.  <br>- Inventory management included $27.5B merchandise investments and improved shrink estimation methods, with auditors confirming no material misstatements from shrinkage.  <br>- Operating cash flow declined due to inventory buildup, while financing activities included $5,995M long-term debt issuance (partially used for $5,000M share repurchases and debt repayment).  <br>- Liquidity improvements reflect intentional strategies: optimizing working capital, maintaining cash reserves, and balancing debt financing with shareholder returns.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-equity ratio improved from non-meaningful (2021 negative equity of -$1,696M) to 48.0x in 2022 ($74,883M liabilities/$1,562M equity), driven by positive equity from $18,294M NOPAT operational performance.  <br>- Total liabilities increased from $73,572M (2021) to $74,883M (2022), including $7B senior notes issued for share repurchases/debt repayment.  <br>- $6.7B 2022 share repurchases limited equity growth despite transitioning from negative to positive equity.  <br>- Interest coverage ratio remained strong at 13.9x (2022 EBIT $22,477M vs. $1,617M interest) vs. 16.1x in 2021 ($21,737M EBIT/$1,347M interest).  <br>- Solvency risk persists with 48.0x liabilities/equity ratio (2022), reflecting heavy debt reliance despite improved equity position.  <br>- Negative 2021 equity precluded meaningful solvency/debt-to-equity ratios, resolved by 2022 profitability and capital structure adjustments.  <br>- Strategic debt usage for corporate activities (buybacks, refinancing) maintained liquidity but amplified leverage concerns.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) increased from 39.3 days (2021) to 54.6 days (2022), driven by slower inventory turnover (DIO rose from 80.0 to 86.8 days) due to strategic inventory buildup for supply chain resilience and seasonal merchandise preparation.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) improved slightly from 8.3 days (2021) to 7.7 days (2022), reflecting marginally faster receivables collection.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) decreased from 49.0 days (2021) to 39.9 days (2022), indicating accelerated supplier payments that may strain vendor relationships despite tighter cash management.  <br>- Inventory management decisions, including maintaining higher in-stock levels and preemptive seasonal stockpiling, were primary contributors to the extended CCC despite their operational necessity during global supply chain disruptions.

        The company has shown consistent growth in net sales, controlled operating expenses, and improving net earnings. The improvement in equity position and strong cash liquidity are positive indicators. Despite challenges like slower inventory turnover and high debt levels, the company's overall financial health and effective management suggest that next year's EPS will increase.
