          - No line items in the income statement showed significant changes (greater than +/-5%) in percentage of total revenue between Fiscal 2023 and 2022.  <br>- Net income declined 11.47% year-over-year, marking a substantial profitability drop.  <br>- Merchandise inventories as a percentage of total assets decreased by 5.14% year-over-year.  <br>- Retained earnings as a percentage of total liabilities and equity increased by 8.75%.  <br>- Treasury stock as a percentage of total liabilities and equity decreased by 10.40 percentage points.  <br>- Total shareholders‚Äô equity fell 33.16% year-over-year, reflecting significant erosion in equity value.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross profit margin decreased slightly from 33.5% (2022) to 33.3% (2023) due to higher production costs or markdowns, supported by retail inventory method impacts and a 3.7% decline in merchandise inventories.  <br>- Operating profit margin declined from 15.3% to 14.2% as SG&A expenses (salaries, advertising, store operations) rose faster than sales, compressing efficiency.  <br>- Net profit margin fell from 10.8% to 9.9% with net earnings dropping from $17,105 million to $15,143 million, reflecting expense pressures despite stable sales.  <br>- ROA decreased from 22.4% to 19.8% due to lower net earnings against a stable asset base, signaling reduced asset utilization effectiveness.  <br>- ROE surged from 1,095% to 1,450% primarily from $7,951 million in share buybacks reducing equity, artificially amplifying returns despite profit declines.  <br>- Profitability challenges stemmed from cost management issues in production and operations, while strategic stock repurchases masked earnings erosion in ROE calculation.  <br>- Inventory valuation methods (retail inventory accounting) and expense growth in SG&A categories directly contributed to margin compression across metrics.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio decreased from 1.40 (2023) to 1.35 (2024), reflecting reduced merchandise inventories ($24,886M to $20,976M) and lower inventory purchases impacting current assets.  <br>- Quick ratio improved from 0.33 to 0.40 due to increased cash/cash equivalents ($2,757M to $3,760M) and $6.6B higher net operating cash flow enhancing liquid asset management.  <br>- Cash ratio rose from 0.12 to 0.17, driven by a $1,003M increase in cash reserves and strong operational cash flow performance.  <br>- Inventory management shifts reduced current assets but improved liquidity quality, as evidenced by higher cash-based ratios despite lower overall current ratio.  <br>- Operating cash flow growth ($6.6B increase) directly supported enhanced cash positions and reduced reliance on inventory for short-term obligations.  <br>- Stable liquidity position maintained through strategic balance of inventory optimization and strengthened cash reserves despite marginal current ratio decline.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio rose from 47.9 (2022) to 72.3 (2023) due to $2.0 billion senior notes issuance in November 2023 and share buybacks, increasing long-term debt from $40,843M to $42,150M.  <br>- Solvency ratio (Total Liabilities/Equity) increased from 47.9 to 72.3, driven by higher debt and reduced equity from $2.0 billion debt-funded share repurchases.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio declined from 14.9x to 11.25x as interest expenses rose from increased debt, though coverage remains adequate.  <br>- Equity reduction resulted from aggressive share repurchases, partially financed by new debt, amplifying leverage ratios.  <br>- Financial stability weakened with higher debt reliance and lower equity, but interest obligations remain manageable despite reduced coverage capacity.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DIO decreased from 86.8 to 75.3 days in fiscal 2023, driven by improved inventory management via supply chain enhancements and refined inventory valuation methods.  <br>- DSO increased slightly from 7.7 to 7.9 days due to a minor rise in customer receivables, indicating marginally slower collections while maintaining efficiency.  <br>- DPO declined from 39.8 to 36.0 days, reflecting slower supplier payments enabled by stronger cash flow management and improved cash reserves.  <br>- CCC improved by 7.5 days (54.7 to 47.2 days), primarily from reduced DIO, supported by higher net operating cash flow and increased cash equivalents.  <br>- Inventory turnover acceleration (11.5-day DIO improvement) outweighed the 3.8-day DPO decline, resulting in enhanced working capital efficiency.  <br>- Cash conversion efficiency gains align with balance sheet improvements, including expanded operating cash flow and liquidity for strategic flexibility.

      <h2>üìà Recommendation: ‚ùå SELL</h2>
      <p>
        <!-- Your text goes here. -->
        The company's net earnings have decreased by 11.47% from Fiscal 2022 to Fiscal 2023, with declines in gross profit, operating income, and net profit margins. Despite improvements in cash flow efficiency and liquidity, the overall profitability is trending downward. Increased reliance on debt and share buybacks, while boosting ROE, do not offset the fundamental decline in earnings. Therefore, it is likely that next year's earnings per share will decrease.
