          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin increased to 22.27% in 2021 from 17.81% in 2020, driven by reduced litigation expenses (Consumer Health talc costs down $3.9B to $1.6B; Pharmaceutical segment down $0.8B to $0.6B) and improved cost management.  <br>- Gross profit margin rose to 68.15% from 65.56%, reflecting supply chain optimizations and restructuring initiatives launched in 2018 to reduce operational complexity.  <br>- Operating profit margin improved to 24.28% from 19.97% through operational efficiency gains and better management of variable costs like rebates and promotions.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) increased to 11.47% from 8.41%, indicating enhanced asset utilization from restructuring and productivity improvements.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) climbed to 28.19% from 23.25%, supported by higher net income and efficient equity management amid reduced litigation costs.  <br>- Pharmaceutical segment profitability benefited from divestiture gains and lower litigation expenses; Medical Devices segment rebounded from COVID-19 production disruptions.  <br>- Dividend increases in 2021 demonstrated confidence in sustained profitability and cash flow generation, aligning with improved shareholder returns.  <br>- All profitability ratios (including Return on Sales matching net profit margin at 22.27%) showed year-over-year improvement, highlighting comprehensive efficiency gains in cost control and resource utilization.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved from 1.21 (2020) to 1.35 (2021) due to 19% current assets growth ($51,237M to $60,979M) driven by marketable securities and accounts receivable, outpacing 6.6% current liabilities rise ($42,493M to $45,226M) from payables/accruals.  <br>- Quick ratio increased from 0.99 to 1.12, reflecting enhanced liquidity without inventory reliance, supported by the same asset growth and controlled liability increases.  <br>- Cash ratio slightly declined from 0.33 to 0.32 as cash/cash equivalents rose from $13,985M to $14,487M, offset by higher current liabilities.  <br>- Quick ratio‚Äôs movement above 1 (from below 1) highlights stronger short-term liquidity management, reducing dependence on inventory liquidation.  <br>- Overall liquidity strengthened through disproportionate current asset growth (19%) versus liabilities (6.6%), with the minor cash ratio dip not detracting from improved liquidity trends.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio improved from 1.76 (2020) to 1.46 (2021) due to repayment of $2.65B in maturing notes and reduced long-term debt from $32.6B to $29.9B.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio surged from 82.07 to 124.4 as net earnings grew 41.5% ($14.7B to $20.9B) while maintaining stable interest expenses.  <br>- Solvency Ratio declined from 1.76 to 1.46, driven by shareholders' equity growth from $63.3B to $74B via retained earnings ($113.9B to $123.1B) and comprehensive income.  <br>- Cash reserves increased from $14.0B to $14.5B (2021) with rising marketable securities, supported by strong operating cash flows enabling $3.5B share repurchases.  <br>- Dividend per share increased from $3.98 to $4.19, reflecting confidence in cash flow stability despite debt reduction and capital return activities.  <br>- Total liabilities decreased while assets grew, improving leverage metrics despite $3.5B stock buybacks demonstrating balanced capital allocation.  <br>- Long-term debt reduction and equity expansion reduced financial risk, with interest coverage capacity more than doubling year-over-year.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved by 6.5 days (58 days in 2020 to 51.5 days in 2021) due to enhanced working capital management and strategic payment term optimization.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) slightly improved from ~60 days (2020) to ~59.5 days (2021), reflecting better accounts receivable practices.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) increased from ~120 days (2020) to ~127 days (2021), suggesting potential inefficiencies, stockpiling, or slower-moving products, possibly linked to preparation for Consumer Health business separation.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) rose from ~122 days (2020) to ~135 days (2021), strategically delaying supplier payments to boost cash flow.  <br>- Forward-looking risks (product development delays, market competition) and Consumer Health division separation could further impact inventory levels and operational efficiency.  <br>- While CCC improvement highlights cash flow management success, elevated DIO warrants closer inventory monitoring to mitigate excess stock risks.

        Johnson & Johnson demonstrated strong financial performance in 2021 with significant increases in revenue, gross profit, operating income, and net income. The company's profitability ratios, including net profit margin, gross profit margin, and operating profit margin, all improved, indicating enhanced efficiency. The improved liquidity and solvency positions, along with effective management of working capital, suggest continued financial stability. While there are potential risks such as inventory management and economic uncertainties, JNJ's diversified business model and strong operational performance support the expectation of continued growth. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that next year's earnings per share will increase.
