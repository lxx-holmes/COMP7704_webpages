        Risks:  <br>- Tax law changes in multiple jurisdictions may increase tax liabilities and impact deferred tax valuations.  <br>- Patent challenges and generic/biosimilar competition threaten key pharmaceutical product revenues.  <br>- Inflation and currency devaluation in high-risk markets like Argentina and Turkey could reduce profitability.  <br>- Product development delays or regulatory rejections may hinder growth and fail to offset patent expirations.  <br>- Cybersecurity breaches or IT system failures risk operational disruptions, reputational harm, and regulatory penalties.  <br><br>Opportunities:  <br>- Strong R&D pipeline targeting immunology, oncology, and neuroscience with recent approvals like CARVYKTI¬Æ.  <br>- Strategic acquisitions (e.g., Abiomed) enhance MedTech capabilities in cardiovascular innovation.  <br>- Expanding presence in emerging markets through localized manufacturing and distribution networks.  <br>- Diversified portfolio across Consumer Health, Pharma, and MedTech mitigates sector-specific volatility.  <br>- Planned separation of Consumer Health business (Kenvue) to unlock shareholder value and streamline focus.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross Profit Margin declined from 68.1% (2021) to 67.3% (2022) due to rising production/material costs and adverse currency impacts increasing COGS.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin decreased from 24.3% to 22.8% as operating expenses grew faster than sales, including MedTech litigation costs.  <br>- Net Profit Margin fell from 22.2% to 18.9% driven by higher effective tax rate (8.3% to 17.4%) and $0.5B tax impact from Consumer Health business separation.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) dropped from 11.5% to 9.6% due to asset growth outpacing profit generation, particularly in underperforming segments.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) declined from 28.2% to 23.4% as reduced margins and one-time expenses (Pharmaceutical COVID-19 vaccine exit costs, securities valuation losses) lowered shareholder returns.  <br>- Pharmaceutical segment margins were pressured by $1.3B in COVID-19 vaccine exit expenses and unfavorable R&D partner securities valuations.  <br>- Currency fluctuations negatively impacted Pharmaceutical segment COGS, exacerbating margin contraction.  <br>- All profitability metrics showed deterioration, reflecting systemic challenges from cost inflation, tax impacts, and operational inefficiencies.

          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio improved to 1.44 (from 1.46) as equity increased by $2.78B (to $76.8B) outpacing liabilities growth (+$2.58B to $110.6B), supported by long-term debt reduction ($26.89B in 2022 vs. $29.99B in 2021).  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio declined to 78.6x (from 124.5x) due to higher interest expense ($276M vs. $183M) and lower EBIT ($21.7B vs. $22.8B), influenced by rising interest rates and new credit facilities.  <br>- Equity Ratio rose to 41% (from 40.7%) as equity growth (+$2.78B) exceeded total asset expansion (+$5.36B to $187.4B), driven by net earnings ($17.9B) and other comprehensive income ($91M).  <br>- Total liabilities increased by $2.58B (to $110.6B), while shareholders' equity grew by $2.78B (to $76.8B), reflecting a strategic shift toward equity financing.  <br>- Current portion of long-term debt decreased to $1.55B (from $2.13B), though total debt management included reduced long-term borrowing.  <br>- Higher interest expenses aligned with broader economic trends of rising rates and 2022 credit facility updates.  <br>- EBIT decline contributed to reduced interest coverage capacity despite strong absolute profitability.  <br>- Equity growth was bolstered by retained earnings and comprehensive income, enhancing long-term stability.  <br>- Debt-to-Equity improvement indicates moderate leverage, with 59% of operations funded by equity in 2022.  <br>- Interest coverage remains robust at 78.6x, reflecting sufficient earnings to meet interest obligations despite the decline.

          - Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) rose to 62.2 days in 2022 (vs. 59.4 in 2021), reflecting slower receivables collection linked to global economic uncertainties, supply chain disruptions, and customer payment delays noted in financial statement climate risk disclosures.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) increased to 146.5 days in 2022 (vs. 126.9 in 2021) due to inventory buildup from manufacturing/supply chain delays and weaker demand forecasting, per notes citing operational disruptions.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) grew slightly to 137.4 days in 2022 (vs. 135.3 in 2021) as a cash preservation strategy, though prolonged supplier payment terms risk relationship strain amid global supply chain reliance and regulatory pressures.  <br>- Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) worsened by 20.3 days to 71.3 in 2022, driven by DSO/DIO inefficiencies outweighing marginal DPO gains, highlighting working capital management challenges tied to supply chain and operational risks in financial notes.  <br>- Slower receivables and inventory turnover were exacerbated by climate-related disruptions (extreme weather, natural disasters) and geopolitical conflicts impacting J&J's manufacturing/distribution networks.  <br>- Strategic extension of payables provided short-term cash flow benefits but increased dependency on complex global supplier relationships subject to regulatory scrutiny.  <br>- Inventory management challenges align with financial statement disclosures of difficulties in production timelines and material procurement delays within strained supply chains.

        Based on the analysis of Johnson & Johnson's financial statements from 2020 to 2022, several factors indicate a likely decrease in next year's earnings per share (EPS). The company experienced a decline in net earnings from $20,878 million in 2021 to $17,941 million in 2022, which directly impacts EPS. The EPS itself decreased from $7.93 in 2021 to $6.83 in 2022. Additionally, increasing costs of products sold, higher interest expenses, and declining profit margins all contribute to reduced profitability. The company's return on assets and equity also decreased, indicating less efficient use of resources. Furthermore, liquidity concerns and a worsening cash conversion cycle suggest potential cash flow issues. While increased R&D expenses might offer long-term benefits, they currently strain short-term profitability. Therefore, these factors collectively point to a likely decrease in EPS for the next year.
