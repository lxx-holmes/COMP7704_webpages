        Risks:  <br>- Product development delays and regulatory hurdles may reduce ability to offset revenue losses from patent expirations and competition.  <br>- Currency fluctuations, inflation, and economic instability in international markets (45% of sales) threaten profitability.  <br>- Compliance risks with anti-bribery laws (FCPA, UK Bribery Act) due to frequent government interactions in regulated markets.  <br>- Geopolitical tensions (Russia-Ukraine, Middle East) disrupt supply chains, invite sanctions, and risk intellectual property infringement.  <br>- Cybersecurity breaches and AI adoption risks could lead to operational disruptions, legal liabilities, and reputational damage.  <br><br>Opportunities:  <br>- New products launched in the past five years drove 25% of 2023 sales, signaling strong R&D pipeline potential.  <br>- Strategic acquisitions (e.g., Abiomed) enhance MedTech portfolio and expand minimally invasive treatment capabilities.  <br>- Asia-Pacific and emerging markets (16% of sales) offer growth via rising healthcare demand and operational expansion.  <br>- AI and data science integration could accelerate innovation, optimize manufacturing, and improve commercial strategies.  <br>- Separation of Kenvue allows focused investment in core pharmaceutical and medical device innovation and market leadership.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross profit margin declined slightly from 69.3% (2022) to 68.8% (2023) due to MedTech commodity inflation and $0.5 billion amortization expenses from the Abiomed acquisition.  <br>- Operating profit margin fell significantly from 24.2% to 17.7%, driven by $7.0 billion talc litigation charges and $0.4 billion Kenvue stake valuation loss.  <br>- Net profit margin surged from 22.4% to 41.3% primarily due to a one-time gain from the Kenvue separation via discontinued operations.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) improved from 9.6% to 21.0%, reflecting asset efficiency gains amplified by the non-recurring Kenvue transaction.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) doubled from 23.3% to 51.1%, driven by elevated net earnings from discontinued operations.  <br>- Declining operating margins highlight operational inefficiencies, requiring improved cost management beyond reliance on one-time gains.  <br>- Sustainability concerns arise from profit margin improvements being disproportionately tied to non-repeatable discontinued operations gains.  <br>- MedTech segment pressures and litigation costs underscore the need for core operational performance enhancements to maintain long-term profitability.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-equity ratio remained stable at 1.44 in 2023 and 2022 due to proportional reductions in total debt (from $110,574M to $98,784M) and equity (from $76,804M to $68,774M).  <br>- Interest coverage ratio declined sharply from 70.13 (2022) to 19.51 (2023) driven by a 21% EBIT decrease ($19,359M to $15,062M) and 180% interest expense increase ($276M to $772M).  <br>- Higher operating expenses (COGS, selling, R&D) and rising interest rates on commercial paper reduced EBIT and increased financing costs.  <br>- Kenvue separation contributed to increased short-term debt through cash transfers and restructuring, amplifying interest expenses despite IPO proceeds strengthening cash reserves ($18.4B to $23.7B).  <br>- Solvency ratio (total liabilities/equity) held steady at 1.44, reflecting maintained debt financing reliance despite absolute debt reduction of $11,790M.  <br>- Stable leverage metrics mask emerging risks from deteriorating interest coverage capacity, necessitating improved profitability or debt restructuring.

          - DSO remained stable at 52 days (2022-2023) due to consistent customer collections; accounts receivable increased slightly from $14,039M to $14,873M, aligning with sales growth without significant delays.  <br>- DIO rose from 60 to 61 days, reflecting marginally slower inventory turnover; inventories grew from $10,268M to $11,181M, likely due to supply chain disruptions and stockpiling to address shortages.  <br>- DPO decreased from 146 to 133 days, indicating faster supplier payments; strategic prioritization of supplier relationships amid supply chain pressures and reliance on third-party manufacturers drove this shift.  <br>- CCC improved from -34 to -20 days, reflecting enhanced working capital management; Kenvue separation (August 2023) generated cash inflows, boosting cash equivalents from $12,889M to $21,859M.  <br>- Kenvue separation streamlined operations, reducing complexity and contributing to cash flow optimization.  <br>- Supply chain risks and manufacturing challenges cited in disclosures impacted inventory turnover and payment timelines.  <br>- Proactive payment practices stabilized collections and supplier partnerships despite external pressures like global supply chain volatility.

        The company's core operations are showing signs of weakness with decreasing earnings from continuing operations and lower operating margins. While the one-time gain from discontinued operations boosted this year's EPS, it is unlikely to recur. Increased expenses in R&D and selling, along with higher financial leverage and decreased interest coverage, pose risks. These factors suggest that next year's EPS will likely decrease.
