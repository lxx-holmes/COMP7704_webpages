          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin improved from 23.4% (2020) to 25.3% (2021) due to cost control, operational efficiency, ASU 2019-12 adoption, and gains from investments/BodyArmor acquisition.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin rose from 59.3% to 60.2%, reflecting better COGS management through operational efficiencies or pricing strategies.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin declined slightly (27.2% to 26.6%) due to higher operating expenses, including marketing, incentive costs, restructuring charges, and pension plan settlements.  <br>- ROA increased from 8.87% to 10.36% driven by asset sales, operational efficiency, ASU 2019-12 benefits, and favorable foreign currency impacts.  <br>- ROE rose from 36.4% to 39.3% from higher net income, equity growth, ASU 2019-12, and investment sale gains.  <br>- ROIC improved from 12.38% to 13.86% due to strategic investments (e.g., BodyArmor acquisition) and divestiture of non-core assets.  <br>- Key drivers included cost control, operational efficiency, strategic acquisitions/divestitures, and favorable tax/accounting changes.  <br>- Increased operating expenses (marketing, incentives, restructuring) partially offset profitability gains.  <br>- Accounting Standard ASU 2019-12 simplified income tax accounting, boosting net income metrics.  <br>- Foreign currency exchange rate tailwinds contributed to improved asset utilization and profitability.

          - Current ratio decreased from 1.32 (2020) to 1.13 (2021) as current liabilities grew 36% (outpacing 17% asset growth), driven by higher accounts payable and accrued expenses.  <br>- Quick ratio declined from 1.09 to 0.96, indicating reduced ability to meet short-term obligations with liquid assets despite a 43% cash increase to $9,684M.  <br>- Cash ratio improved slightly from 0.465 to 0.485, reflecting strengthened cash reserves ($6,795M to $9,684M) covering short-term debts.  <br>- Current assets rose $19,240M to $22,545M primarily through higher receivables and cash, while current liabilities surged $14,601M to $19,950M.  <br>- Inventory increased marginally, potentially due to operational adjustments or supply chain challenges.  <br>- Working capital management requires attention as liability growth exceeds asset expansion, despite improved cash liquidity.  <br>- Accounts payable and accrued expenses were key drivers of the $5.3B current liabilities increase between 2020-2021.

          - Debt-to-Equity ratio decreased from 3.10x (2020) to 2.79x (2021), driven by retiring $6.5B USD and ‚Ç¨2.43B euro notes, partially offset by $5.95B USD and ‚Ç¨3.15B euro note issuances, reducing debt reliance.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio improved from 7.78x to 8.79x due to higher earnings and using operating cash flows to settle $6.5B long-term debt and interest payments.  <br>- Debt-to-Asset ratio declined from 75.6% to 73.6%, reflecting capital structure optimization through debt reduction and equity management.  <br>- Operational efficiency gains strengthened earnings, supporting increased interest expense coverage and overall financial stability.  <br>- Strategic debt management included net debt reduction despite new issuances, prioritizing financial health over aggressive leveraging.

          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved from -179.9 days (2020) to -233.2 days (2021) driven by enhanced working capital management across DSO, DIO, and DPO.  <br>- DSO decreased from 34.7 to 33.1 days, reflecting faster receivables collection via improved collection practices or customer payment incentives.  <br>- DIO improved from 88.7 to 81.0 days due to accelerated inventory turnover, supported by better supplier agreements and commodity risk management using derivatives.  <br>- DPO increased from 303.3 to 347.3 days, indicating extended supplier payment terms to retain cash longer, as noted in financial statement disclosures.  <br>- Negative CCC demonstrates efficient use of supplier credit, converting inventory and receivables to cash before paying obligations.  <br>- Overall improvements in inventory turnover and payables terms boosted cash flow and liquidity, highlighting effective working capital strategies.

        The Coca-Cola Company demonstrated strong financial performance in 2021 with significant increases in net operating revenues, gross profit, operating income, and net income. The improvement in profitability ratios such as net profit margin, ROA, and ROE, along with better cash flow management and a stronger solvency position, suggests that the company is well-positioned for continued growth. These positive trends indicate that earnings per share (EPS) are likely to increase next year.
