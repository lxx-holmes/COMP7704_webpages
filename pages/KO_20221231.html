          - Other income (loss) ‚Äî net decreased from 5.17% of total revenue in 2021 to -0.61% in 2022, a -5.78 percentage point change.  <br>- Total revenue grew 11.1% year-over-year from 2021 to 2022, reflecting strong operational performance.  <br>- Marketable securities declined sharply from 1.80% to 1.15% of total assets/liabilities (‚âà-36% relative change), indicating reduced liquid investments.  <br>- Inventories rose significantly from 3.62% to 4.56% of total assets/liabilities (‚âà+26% relative change), suggesting increased stockpiling or supply chain adjustments.  <br>- Equity attributable to shareowners increased from 26.35% to 27.85% of total liabilities & equity (‚âà+5.7% relative change), showing improved ownership value.  <br>- Total assets decreased marginally by 1.59% year-over-year ($94,354 to $92,763), while total liabilities fell 3.65% ($69,494 to $66,937).  <br>- Shareholders' equity grew 3.86% year-over-year ($24,860 to $25,826), though all YoY growth metrics for assets, liabilities, and equity remained below ¬±10% significance thresholds.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin declined from 25.3% (2021) to 22.2% (2022) due to higher expenses from inflation/supply chain disruptions and potential reduced pricing power, with refranchising operations impacting COGS.  <br>- Gross profit margin decreased from 60.3% to 58.1% primarily from increased COGS driven by inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges.  <br>- Operating profit margin fell slightly from 26.6% to 25.4% as marketing/promotional activities raised operating expenses despite stable revenue.  <br>- ROA remained stable at 10.3%-10.4%, reflecting effective asset utilization amid external economic pressures.  <br>- ROE declined from 39.3% to 37.0% due to increased equity (notably noncontrolling interests) and lower net income partially impacted by $423M tax reserve for uncertain tax positions.  <br>- ROIC improved from 12.4% to 13.3%, showing enhanced efficiency in capital allocation despite margin compression.  <br>- Variable consideration in revenue recognition methods introduced uncertainty in sales volume/pricing estimates.  <br>- Margin compression across net/gross/operating metrics signals challenges from cost inflation and competitive pressures, though asset/capital management remains effective.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current Ratio improved from 1.13 (2021) to 1.145 (2022) due to a marginal increase in current assets ($22,545M to $22,591M) and reduced current liabilities ($19,950M to $19,724M), enhancing short-term liquidity.  <br>- Quick Ratio declined from 0.96 to 0.93 as cash/cash equivalents decreased ($9,684M to $9,519M), short-term investments dropped ($1,242M to $1,043M), and inventories rose ($3,414M to $4,233M), reducing immediate liquidity coverage.  <br>- Cash Ratio fell from 0.63 to 0.59 due to a proportional cash decline exceeding current liability reductions, with net operating cash flow decreasing from $12,625M (2021) to $11,018M (2022).  <br>- Investing activities (PP&E purchases, investments) and financing activities (dividends, treasury stock purchases) contributed to lower cash reserves.  <br>- Despite Quick/Cash Ratio declines, Coca-Cola maintains stable liquidity supported by market leadership and financing access, though liquid reserves require monitoring.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio decreased from 2.34 (2021) to 2.17 (2022) due to long-term debt retirements (Swiss franc notes, U.S. dollar debentures) and refinancing of short-term borrowings into long-term debt.  <br>- Times Interest Earned ratio rose from 7.61x to 12.74x, driven by increased operating income/net earnings outpacing higher interest expenses from new debt issuances.  <br>- Fixed Charge Coverage ratio improved from 7.61x to 12.74x, supported by earnings growth and stable lease expenses (though lease cost data wasn‚Äôt explicitly disclosed).  <br>- Strategic debt reductions lowered total debt from $43.3B to $38.5B between 2021-2022, while refinancing improved debt maturity profiles.  <br>- Profitability gains (e.g., 7% operating income growth in 2022) enhanced interest coverage capacity despite rising average interest rates on new borrowings.  <br>- Overall solvency improvements reflect disciplined debt management, earnings expansion, and proactive refinancing, reducing financial risk and strengthening stability.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO improved from 33.3 days (2021) to 29.5 days (2022) due to enhanced collection practices or early payment incentives, boosting liquidity.  <br>- DIO worsened from 78.3 days (2021) to 83.5 days (2022) due to potential overstocking, supply chain disruptions, or increased purchase obligations.  <br>- DPO decreased from 340.8 days (2021) to 305.3 days (2022) as the company accelerated supplier payments, possibly via renegotiated terms or short-term borrowings, reducing cash reserves.  <br>- CCC improved from -229.2 days (2021) to -192.3 days (2022), reflecting stronger cash management through faster receivables and payables efficiency, offset partially by inventory challenges.  <br>- Slower inventory turnover (-5 days) and reduced payment terms (-35 days) require monitoring despite overall CCC progress.

        The prediction is based on the slight decline in key profitability metrics such as net profit margin, gross profit margin, and operating profit margin from 2021 to 2022. Additionally, the increase in cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses, along with margin compression, suggests potential challenges in maintaining or increasing earnings per share. While the company has a strong market position and efficient cash management, the current trends indicate possible downward pressure on EPS next year.
