          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross Profit Margin increased from 58.1% (2022) to 59.6% (2023) due to improved production efficiency and cost management, supported by higher net operating revenues.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin declined slightly from 25.4% (2022) to 24.7% (2023) amid rising operating expenses, including increased marketing spending and commodity costs in regions like Latin America and North America.  <br>- Net Profit Margin improved from 22.2% (2022) to 23.4% (2023) driven by higher net income and a reduced effective tax rate (18.1% to 17.4%).  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) rose from 10.3% (2022) to 11.0% (2023) as net income growth outpaced the 5.3% increase in total assets, reflecting better asset utilization.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) increased from 37.0% (2022) to 39.0% (2023) due to higher net income and a slight reduction in equity, enhancing equity efficiency.  <br>- Overall profitability improvements stemmed from revenue growth and cost controls, while operating margin pressure was tied to inflationary expenses and strategic marketing investments.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio decreased slightly from 1.15 (2022) to 1.13 (2023) due to increased current liabilities, particularly short-term debt from additional loans/notes payable.  <br>- Quick ratio declined from 0.77 to 0.72 as cash/cash equivalents fell from $9,519M to $9,366M while current liabilities rose.  <br>- Cash ratio dropped from 0.54 to 0.52 due to reduced cash reserves and higher current liabilities, including current maturities of long-term debt.  <br>- Short-term debt increased in 2023 through commercial paper, credit lines, and debt issuances, raising current liability pressures.  <br>- Operating cash flows remained stable at $11,599M (2023), but higher investing outflows reduced available cash reserves.  <br>- Debt financing activities expanded in 2023, contributing to liquidity ratio declines despite maintained operational cash generation.  <br>- All ratios (current, quick, cash) remain above healthy thresholds, indicating ongoing ability to meet short-term obligations.  <br>- Monitoring recommended to assess sustainability of liquidity position amid continued debt management and cash flow trends.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio improved from 2.59 (2022) to 2.55 (2023) due to reduced current maturities of long-term debt ($1,960M to $399M) and increased equity ($24,105M to $25,941M) from retained earnings and stock buybacks.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio declined sharply from 12.37√ó (2022) to 7.41√ó (2023) despite higher net income ($9,571M to $10,703M), driven by $6,891M new debt issuances increasing interest expenses and potential rate impacts.  <br>- Financial Leverage Ratio improved marginally from 3.59 (2022) to 3.55 (2023) through active debt mix management and use of operating cash flows for repayments, lowering overall borrowing costs.  <br>- Reduced debt reliance and improved stability offset by heightened interest payment risks, with interest coverage decline signaling tighter earnings capacity relative to obligations.  <br>- Debt repayment strategy included prioritizing short-term maturities while maintaining long-term debt flexibility, as noted in financial statement disclosures.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) worsened slightly from 35 days (2022) to 36 days (2023), driven by mixed efficiency across working capital components.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) improved to 26 days (from 29 days) due to increased trade receivables factoring ($17.7B sold in 2023 vs. $10.7B in 2022), accelerating cash collection.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) increased to 86 days (from 84 days) due to 2022 inventory buildup for supply chain resilience and ongoing inventory management challenges.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) decreased to 76 days (from 78 days) despite unchanged 120-day supplier terms, linked to a voluntary supply chain finance program enabling suppliers to sell receivables early.  <br>- Improved receivables efficiency offset by slower inventory turnover and marginally faster supplier payments, resulting in the 1-day CCC increase.  <br>- Management should prioritize inventory optimization to counterbalance efficiency losses and enhance overall cash flow.

        The Coca-Cola Company has shown consistent growth in net income and improvements in key profitability margins such as gross profit, net profit, ROA, and ROE. Despite slight declines in some ratios like the interest coverage, the overall financial health, strong liquidity, and effective debt management suggest continued growth. Therefore, it is predicted that the EPS will increase next year.
