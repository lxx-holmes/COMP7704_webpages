          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin improved from 9.2% (2020) to 12.4% (2021) driven by 13% sales growth (volume, pricing, currency) and cost reduction programs enhancing net income.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin increased from 12.2% to 16.2% due to 50% reported/24% adjusted operating profit growth via higher volumes, pricing, and cost-saving measures.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin slightly declined from 43.5% to 43.0% as cost of sales rose relative to revenue despite higher sales; minor dip may not be concerning unless persistent.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) rose from 2.8% to 4.7% through improved asset utilization and higher net income, reflecting better income generation from assets.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) increased from 5.1% to 8.4% due to higher net income and stable equity levels, boosting shareholder returns.  <br>- Sales grew 13% in 2021 driven by volume growth, price increases, and favorable currency translation.  <br>- Cost reduction programs and productivity initiatives lowered expenses, contributing to margin improvements across profitability ratios.  <br>- Operational efficiency gains from strong geographic segment performance and long-term contracts enabled cost pass-through and stable cash flow.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio decreased 5.1% (0.745 in 2021 vs. 0.795 in 2020), reflecting weakened liquidity due to a $1,171M increase in contract liabilities shifting current liability composition.  <br>- Quick ratio declined 6.8% (0.547 in 2021 vs. 0.588 in 2020) as working capital management became less efficient, with slower receivables conversion despite 13% sales growth.  <br>- Cash ratio plummeted 24.2% (0.207 in 2021 vs. 0.273 in 2020) driven by a $931M reduction in cash equivalents and $7,588M cash outflows for debt repayment/share buybacks.  <br>- Operating cash flow proved insufficient to offset liquidity strain despite revenue growth, as financing activities dominated cash usage.  <br>- Net debt increased post-purchase accounting adjustments, compounding liquidity pressures from rising obligations.  <br>- Contract assets decreased while accounts receivable slightly increased, signaling challenges in converting sales to cash.  <br>- Management priority should focus on optimizing working capital, liability mix, and cash retention to restore short-term flexibility.

          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased slightly from 0.78 (2020) to 0.80 (2021) due to a 12% debt reduction ($16,154M to $14,207M) overshadowed by a larger 7% equity decline ($47,317M to $44,035M), primarily from $4.4B increase in treasury shares via buybacks.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio surged from 28.89x to 64.73x driven by higher operating profits and reduced interest expenses, as Linde repaid high-interest debt (3.875% Euro notes 2021, 2.45% Notes 2022) and issued lower-cost debt (0.00% Euro notes 2026).  <br>- Solvency Ratio (Total Liabilities/Equity) rose marginally from 0.78 to 0.80, reflecting stable leverage despite total liabilities decreasing 6% ($38,647M to $36,164M) and equity declining 7% over the period.  <br>- Debt management strategies optimized capital structure, lowering interest costs while maintaining moderate leverage (total debt reduced $1.95B in 2021).  <br>- Equity reduction of $3.28B was accelerated by $4.43B in share buybacks (treasury shares grew from $5,374M to $9,808M), offsetting retained earnings contributions.  <br>- Improved operating performance strengthened earnings capacity, with interest coverage ratio more than doubling year-over-year despite absolute debt reduction.
