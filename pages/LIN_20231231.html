          - Cost of sales decreased by 5.1 percentage points (58.3% to 53.2% of revenue), improving gross margin.  <br>- Gross profit increased 5.0 percentage points (41.7% to 46.7% of revenue) with 10.4% YoY growth ($13,914M to $15,362M).  <br>- Other charges declined 3.0 percentage points (3.1% to 0.1% of revenue), reducing overhead expenses.  <br>- Operating profit rose 8.3 percentage points (16.1% to 24.4% of revenue), reflecting 49.5% YoY growth ($5,369M to $8,024M).  <br>- Net income increased 6.5 percentage points (12.8% to 19.3% of revenue) with 49.5% YoY growth ($4,147M to $6,199M).  <br>- Retained earnings declined 14.86 percentage points (25.81% to 10.95% of total assets/liabilities & equity), signaling reduced accumulated profits.  <br>- Treasury shares decreased 14.63 percentage points (18.51% to 3.88% of total assets/liabilities & equity), indicating share buyback adjustments.  <br>- Total assets grew 1.45% ($79,658M to $80,811M), while liabilities increased 3.77% ($38,271M to $39,716M) and equity declined 0.77% ($40,028M to $39,720M).  <br>- No material YoY changes in total assets/liabilities growth, as all metrics remained below 10% thresholds.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin increased from 12.4% to 18.9% (+6.5%) driven by cost control, operational efficiency, and reduced cost of sales ($17.5B in 2023 vs. $19.45B in 2022).  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) rose from 5.2% to 7.7% (+2.5%) due to improved asset utilization from strategic capital expenditures focused on efficiency.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) grew from 10.0% to 15.0% (+5.0%) boosted by share buybacks reducing the equity base and higher net income distribution efficiency.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin improved from 41.7% to 46.8% (+5.1%) primarily due to lower cost of sales and enhanced cost management practices.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin increased from 16.1% to 24.4% (+8.3%) resulting from higher sales efficiency and reduced operating expenses, despite a slight overall sales decline.  <br>- 2022 profitability was impacted by one-time charges of $1,029 million related to Russian subsidiary deconsolidation and impairment, making 2023's performance appear more stable in comparison.  <br>- Strategic share repurchases contributed to equity base reduction, enhancing ROE metrics despite unchanged net income levels.  <br>- Overall 2023 profitability improvements reflect effective cost containment, operational streamlining, absence of major one-time costs, and optimized asset deployment.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved slightly from 0.79x (2022) to 0.80x (2023), driven by proportional decreases in current assets ($13,047M to $12,620M) and liabilities ($16,479M to $15,717M), but remains below 1.0x indicating liquidity challenges.  <br>- Quick ratio remained stable at 0.61x both years, as cash/cash equivalents fell $772M (from $5,436M to $4,664M) while inventories/prepaid assets stayed stable, showing no improvement in liquid asset coverage.  <br>- Cash ratio declined from 0.33x to 0.30x due to $772M cash reduction from capital expenditures ($3,787M), acquisitions ($953M), and share buybacks ($3,925M), despite higher operating cash flow ($9,305M vs. $8,864M).  <br>- Liquidity pressures stemmed from significant cash outflows for investments and shareholder returns, offsetting operational cash flow growth and highlighting working capital management needs.  <br>- All ratios remain below 1.0x, reflecting suboptimal liquidity despite marginal current ratio improvement, necessitating enhanced cash reserve management and working capital optimization.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased from 0.92 (2022) to 0.97 (2023) due to $1,060 million net debt borrowings and $3,925 million share buybacks reducing equity.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio declined from 85.22 to 40.12 as borrowing costs rose (short-term interest rates increased from 3.2% to 4.8%), despite replacing some high-interest debt.  <br>- Solvency Ratio decreased slightly from 2.08 to 2.03, reflecting $3,787 million capital expenditures and $953 million acquisitions that grew assets less proportionally than liabilities.  <br>- Higher financial risk stems from $2,482 million dividend payouts and share repurchases reducing cash reserves, though overall solvency remains stable.  <br>- Debt management included issuing new notes (3.625% and 3.375%) while repaying 5.875% GBP notes, maintaining elevated interest expenses.  <br>- Increased leverage supports expansion/acquisition strategy but requires monitoring given rising borrowing costs and reduced liquidity buffers.

          - Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increased from 50.0 days (2022) to 52.5 days (2023), indicating slower customer collections or extended credit terms, potentially due to weaker payment practices.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) rose from 37.1 days (2022) to 44.1 days (2023), suggesting inventory overstocking, slower sales, or supply chain inefficiencies, with a $4.9 billion project backlog delaying returns.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) increased from 56.2 days (2022) to 63.0 days (2023), reflecting extended supplier payment terms that improve cash retention but risk straining supplier relationships.  <br>- Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) worsened from 30.9 days (2022) to 33.6 days (2023), driven by DSO/DIO increases and DPO expansion, signaling reduced working capital efficiency despite slightly higher operational cash flows.  <br>- Higher working capital requirements included reduced contract liability inflows and increased cash tax payments, exacerbating CCC inefficiencies.  <br>- Inventory challenges are linked to slower sales realization for large projects, while receivables management needs optimization to accelerate collections.  <br>- Supplier payment term extensions contributed to cash retention benefits but require balance to maintain healthy vendor relations.  <br>- Overall working capital management requires improvements in inventory turnover, receivables collection speed, and strategic alignment of payables terms.

        Linde plc has shown significant improvements in profitability metrics, including a substantial increase in operating profit and net income, driven by effective cost management and operational efficiency. The company's ability to reduce costs and integrate acquisitions successfully, along with strong cash flow generation, positions it well for continued growth. While there are challenges such as rising interest rates and liquidity ratio concerns, the overall positive trends suggest that earnings per share will likely increase next year.
