        **Risks:**  <br>- Ongoing litigation and investigations related to product liability, pricing practices, and commercial disputes, exposing the company to significant financial charges and reputational harm.  <br>- Manufacturing and supply chain vulnerabilities, including quality control issues, raw material shortages, and global logistics disruptions, risking product shortages and regulatory non-compliance.  <br>- Reliance on third-party relationships for clinical trials, manufacturing, and IT systems, creating operational risks if partners fail to meet obligations or face cybersecurity breaches.  <br>- Intense government and private payer pressure on drug pricing, including potential U.S. legislation mandating price negotiations for insulin and restrictive reimbursement policies.  <br>- Foreign currency exchange rate volatility and interest rate fluctuations, impacting international revenue and debt servicing costs despite hedging efforts.  <br><br>**Opportunities:**  <br>- Strong growth in diabetes therapies (e.g., Trulicity¬Æ, Jardiance¬Æ) and oncology products (e.g., Verzenio¬Æ, Retevmo¬Æ), supported by expanding indications and market demand.  <br>- Robust R&D pipeline with potential breakthroughs in Alzheimer‚Äôs (donanemab), COVID-19 therapies, and immunology, driving long-term revenue diversification.  <br>- Strategic acquisitions (e.g., Prevail Therapeutics) and partnerships enhancing pipeline depth in gene therapy and oncology, targeting underserved medical needs.  <br>- Expansion in international markets, particularly Europe and Asia, leveraging diversified geographic revenue streams to offset U.S. pricing pressures.  <br>- Share repurchase programs ($5B authorization in 2021) and strong cash flow ($7.7B comprehensive income in 2021) supporting shareholder returns and financial flexibility.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin declined from 25.2% (2020) to 19.7% (2021) due to higher operational costs (32% R&D increase), COVID-19 supply chain disruptions, and reduced pricing power despite 15% revenue growth.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin fell from 77.6% to 70.7%, driven by pandemic-related manufacturing/labor cost increases, transportation strains, and a slight decline in collaboration/royalty revenue.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin dropped from 29.5% to 21.7% as operating expenses rose 10%, including investments in COVID-19 antibody manufacturing and a 32% surge in acquired R&D costs.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) decreased from 13.2% to 11.4% due to pandemic-driven asset utilization inefficiencies and a 15% income-before-taxes decline despite revenue growth.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) plummeted from 106.3% to 61.0% primarily from a 45% net income decline, amplified by higher expenses and operational inefficiencies.  <br>- Strategic R&D investments (notably COVID-19 therapies) and pandemic-related operational disruptions contributed to short-term margin erosion, offsetting revenue growth of $28.3B (15% YoY increase).  <br>- Gross margin as a percentage of revenue declined from 77.7% to 74.2%, reflecting production cost pressures and potential product discounting.  <br>- MD&A cited supply chain instability and increased sales/R&D costs as critical challenges, necessitating management‚Äôs focus on cost optimization and operational efficiency improvements.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio decreased from 1.40 (2020) to 1.23 (2021) due to a $2.5B increase in current liabilities (from $12.48B to $15.05B), outpacing asset growth; remains above 1, indicating ability to meet obligations but with weakened liquidity.  <br>- Quick ratio declined from 1.08 to 0.97, reflecting reduced ability to cover short-term liabilities with liquid assets (excluding inventories), as liabilities grew faster than cash and equivalents.  <br>- Cash ratio dropped from 0.29 to 0.25, signaling weaker cash coverage of liabilities despite cash reserves increasing from $3,657.1M to $3,818.5M, insufficient against liability growth.  <br>- Current liabilities rose by $2.5B, driven by short-term borrowings and current debt maturities, increasing the denominator in liquidity ratios and reducing all three metrics.  <br>- Inventories decreased slightly from $3,980.3M to $3,886.0M, insufficient to offset liability growth, contributing to lower quick ratio despite inventory reduction.  <br>- Cash and equivalents grew modestly (up $161.4M), but the rise in liabilities outpaced this, leading to lower cash ratio and highlighting cash management needs.  <br>- Overall liquidity weakened, but ratios above 1 indicate continued short-term solvency; management must improve cash flow and asset efficiency to strengthen position.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio decreased from ~7.01 (2020) to ~4.33 (2021), reflecting reduced debt reliance and improved solvency due to long-term debt decreasing from $16,586.6M to $15,346.4M.  <br>- Solvency Ratio (Total Liabilities to Equity) declined from ~7.01 (2020) to ~4.09 (2021), driven by debt reduction and equity growth.  <br>- Equity Ratio increased from 12.5% (2020) to 18.7% (2021) as total equity rose from $5,825.2M to $9,154.8M, strengthening financial stability.  <br>- Long-term debt decreased by $1,240.2M (Note 11: Borrowings), directly improving Debt-to-Equity and Solvency Ratios.  <br>- Total equity grew by $3,329.6M (Consolidated Balance Sheets), enhancing equity position and reducing leverage.  <br>- Management's focus on financial stability and internal controls (per Management's Report) supported sustainable debt reduction and equity growth.  <br>- Reduced debt levels and expanded equity base collectively improved solvency metrics, signaling stronger financial health.

          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved by 48.5 days (2021: 197 days vs. 2020: 245.5 days), driven by enhanced working capital management across receivables, inventory, and payables.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) decreased slightly from 87.5 days (2020) to 86 days (2021), reflecting marginally faster receivables collection and improved cash flow.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) dropped sharply from 265 days (2020) to 194 days (2021), indicating accelerated inventory turnover, reduced holding costs, and optimized supply chain efficiency.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) declined from 107 days (2020) to 83 days (2021), demonstrating strategic use of supplier credit to extend payment terms and preserve cash liquidity.  <br>- Combined improvements in DSO, DIO, and DPO strengthened overall cash flow efficiency, reducing working capital cycle duration and enhancing operational liquidity.

        Eli Lilly and Company's earnings per share (EPS) are expected to decrease next year due to increasing expenses, particularly in research and development (R&D) and marketing, which are outpacing revenue growth. Despite revenue increases, the decline in profitability margins and net income suggests that current investments in growth areas may not immediately translate to higher EPS. The company's focus on R&D and marketing, while strategic for long-term growth, is currently impacting short-term profitability.
