        - Launched Mounjaro (tirzepatide) in 2022 for type 2 diabetes, leveraging dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonism technology to drive rapid adoption and revenue growth, with expanded cardiovascular outcome trials underway.  <br>- Advanced late-stage pipeline with 45+ candidates, including regulatory submissions for lebrikizumab (atopic dermatitis) and mirikizumab (ulcerative colitis) in 2022, and Phase III trials for donanemab in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.  <br>- Acquired Akouos to expand gene therapy capabilities in hearing loss treatments, adding clinical-stage assets like AK-OTOF for genetic hearing disorders to the pipeline.  <br>- Strengthened neuroscience portfolio through Prevail Therapeutics‚Äô acquisition, advancing PR001 (Parkinson‚Äôs) and PR006 (frontotemporal dementia) gene therapies with FDA Fast Track designations.  <br>- Accelerated oncology growth with FDA accelerated approval of Jaypirca (pirtobrutinib) for mantle cell lymphoma in January 2023, following Phase II data and ongoing Phase III trials.  <br>- Expanded manufacturing capacity for incretin therapies (e.g., Trulicity, Mounjaro) to address surging demand, despite industry-wide supply chain and production challenges.  <br>- Invested in R&D collaborations, including partnerships with Foghorn Therapeutics and Precision Biosciences, to target epigenetic regulators and CAR-T cell therapies.  <br>- Enhanced diabetes portfolio with new indications for Jardiance (heart failure) and Trulicity (pediatric use), supported by clinical data demonstrating cardiovascular benefits.  <br>- Faced COVID-19 antibody demand volatility but maintained pandemic-related manufacturing flexibility and inventory management to adapt to evolving treatment landscapes.  <br>- Navigated pricing pressures and formulary access challenges through strategic payer negotiations and global reimbursement strategies for key products like Taltz and Verzenio.

        <!-- Your text goes here. -->
        **Risks:**  <br>- Heavy revenue dependence on key products (69% from 7 drugs), exposing vulnerability to patent losses, safety issues, or competitive pressures.  <br>- Reliance on third-party suppliers, distributors, and outsourcing partners heightens operational risks from performance failures or disruptions.  <br>- COVID-19 and pandemics disrupt supply chains, inflate costs, reduce healthcare interactions, and create demand volatility for therapies.  <br>- Intensifying government pricing controls and reimbursement restrictions (e.g., IRA) threaten revenue from major products like selected therapies.  <br>- Cybersecurity threats and IT system vulnerabilities risk data breaches, operational downtime, and reputational damage.  <br><br>**Opportunities:**  <br>- Growth potential for GLP-1 therapies, including Mounjaro, expected to drive significant revenue as demand increases.  <br>- Strategic acquisitions (e.g., Akouos, Prevail) and partnerships to expand pipeline and enhance innovation in drug development.  <br>- Expansion into international markets (Europe, Asia) offers growth despite geopolitical and regulatory complexities.  <br>- Robust R&D pipeline with late-stage candidates poised to replace revenue from patent-expired products.  <br>- Manufacturing capacity investments to meet rising demand for incretin products and capitalize on market leadership.

          - No significant changes (>5%) in the percentage of total revenue line items between 2022 and 2021.  <br>- Income from operations grew 10.58% year-over-year ($6,155.5M to $6,806.4M).  <br>- Net income increased 11.88% ($5,581.7M to $6,244.8M), reflecting improved profitability.  <br>- Cash and cash equivalents declined from 7.82% to 4.18% of Total Assets (-3.64% change).  <br>- Deferred tax liabilities dropped sharply from 3.55% to 0.18% of Total Liabilities & Equity (-3.37% change).  <br>- Retained earnings decreased from 97.83% to 93.23% of Total Equity (-4.6% change).  <br>- Total shareholders' equity rose 17.7% ($9,154.8M to $10,775.4M), indicating strengthened financial position.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin increased from 19.71% (2021) to 21.87% (2022) due to improved cost management, with net income rising from $5,581.7M to $6,244.8M despite stable revenue ($28.3B to $28.5B).  <br>- Gross profit margin improved from 74.23% to 76.76%, reflecting better COGS control through reduced production costs and maintained pricing power.  <br>- Operating profit margin rose from 21.73% to 23.84%, driven by operational efficiency and expense management with stable revenue.  <br>- ROA increased from 11.43% to 12.61%, indicating more effective asset utilization to generate profits.  <br>- ROE decreased slightly from 60.96% to 57.95% as equity growth outpaced net income, though returns remained robust.  <br>- Dividend payout ratio increased from 15.86% to 16.28%, reflecting a higher distribution of net income to shareholders.  <br>- Overall profitability improvements across metrics highlight operational efficiency and cost management strengths.  <br>- ROE decline signals increased equity financing but maintains strong shareholder returns.  <br>- Dividend policy shift demonstrates commitment to enhancing shareholder value through cash returns.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 1.23x (2021) to 1.05x (2022) due to $2.1B increase in current liabilities (from $15.05B to $17.14B) and slight current asset decrease ($18.45B to $18.03B).  <br>- Quick ratio fell from 0.97x to 0.80x, reflecting reduced liquidity as inventories rose from $3.89B to $4.31B (excluded from quick assets).  <br>- Cash ratio halved from 0.25x to 0.12x, driven by cash/cash equivalents decreasing 46% ($3.82B to $2.07B) against growing liabilities.  <br>- Operating cash flow decreased slightly while cash used in investing (property/equipment purchases) and financing activities (debt repayments, dividends) increased, reducing liquid reserves.  <br>- Higher inventory levels tied up $420M more in less liquid assets, exacerbating liquidity strain despite maintaining current ratio above 1.  <br>- Liquidity erosion signals need for closer monitoring of working capital management and cash preservation strategies.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio improved from 4.1 in 2021 to 3.6 in 2022, driven by $1.56 billion long-term debt repayment and increased equity from $6,244.8 million net income partially offsetting $1.5 billion stock buybacks.  <br>- Strong cash flow from operations ($7,084.4 million in 2022) enabled substantial debt reduction, enhancing financial stability.  <br>- Higher retained earnings from profitability countered equity reduction from share repurchases, improving leverage metrics.  <br>- Insufficient data available to calculate Interest Coverage Ratio, Times Interest Earned Ratio, and Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.  <br>- Reduced leverage indicates lower solvency risk and improved balance between debt and equity financing.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) increased by 22.4 days (196.7 days in 2021 to 219.1 days in 2022), driven primarily by slower inventory turnover.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) surged 43.3 days (194.0 to 237.3 days), indicating potential production delays or inefficiencies, partly due to reliance on key products like Trulicity (26% of 2022 revenue).  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) rose slightly by 2.2 days (86.0 to 88.2 days), reflecting minor slowdown in accounts receivable collection.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) increased 23.1 days (83.3 to 106.4 days), suggesting extended supplier payment terms as a cash conservation strategy.  <br>- Third-party manufacturing/distribution risks and supply chain disruptions mentioned in financial notes likely contributed to inventory management challenges.  <br>- Longer CCC signals reduced cash flow efficiency, requiring investigation into whether trends are temporary or necessitate operational adjustments.
