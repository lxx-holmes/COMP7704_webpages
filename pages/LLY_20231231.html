          - Net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased from 21.89% (2022) to 15.36% (2023), a -6.53% change, despite total revenue growth of 19.56% and gross profit growth of 23.42% year-over-year.  <br>- Net income declined 16.09% year-over-year, contrasting with revenue and gross profit growth.  <br>- Short-term borrowings surged from 3.04% to 10.79% of Total Liabilities & Equity (+7.75%), while total current liabilities increased from 34.64% to 42.63% (+7.99%).  <br>- Total assets grew 29.33% ($49,489.8M to $64,006.3M), outpaced by total liabilities growth of 37.25% ($38,714.4M to $53,142.6M) from 2022 to 2023.  <br>- The company's liability structure shifted toward short-term obligations, with significant increases in both short-term borrowings and current liabilities as proportions of total liabilities.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin decreased from 21.88% (2022) to 15.36% (2023) due to $11,689 million in sales rebates/discounts and increased cost pressures from returns, despite higher revenue.  <br>- Gross profit margin improved from 76.7% to 79.2% through better production cost management and increased high-margin collaboration revenue from partnerships.  <br>- Operating profit margin declined from 23.8% to 19.2% as R&D expenses, clinical trial costs, marketing expenditures, and increased advertising outpaced revenue growth.  <br>- ROA fell from 12.6% to 8.18% due to asset growth without proportional profit increases, reflecting reduced efficiency in asset utilization.  <br>- ROE decreased from 57.9% to 48.2% despite higher equity, driven by lower net income and strategic dividend increases reducing retained earnings.  <br>- Dividend payout ratio rose from 16.3% to 22.3% as a shareholder retention strategy, prioritizing returns over profit retention amid declining margins.  <br>- Revenue growth contrasted with net income decline (-6.52% annualized), showing operational cost pressures despite top-line expansion.  <br>- Total assets grew 21.6% and equity increased 26.1%, but diminishing returns indicate inefficient resource allocation across expanded operations.  <br>- Strategic emphasis shifted toward shareholder value via dividends, compensating for profitability challenges while maintaining production efficiency gains.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 1.05 (2022) to 0.94 (2023) as current liabilities grew 60% (to $27.3B) versus 43% current asset growth (to $25.7B), reducing short-term obligation coverage.  <br>- Quick ratio fell from 0.80 to 0.73 due to a 34% inventory increase (to $5.77B), tying liquidity in less liquid assets while liabilities expanded.  <br>- Cash ratio dropped from 0.13 to 0.11 despite 36% cash growth (to $2.82B), outpaced by surging liabilities and 360% short-term borrowing increase (to $6.9B).  <br>- Short-term borrowings spiked from $1.5B to $6.9B, creating potential repayment risks and liquidity pressure.  <br>- Inventory growth (from $4.3B to $5.8B) reduced asset liquidity, contributing to weaker quick ratio performance.  <br>- Cash reserves grew insufficiently relative to liability expansion, with cash covering only 11% of 2023 liabilities versus 13% in 2022.  <br>- Liquidity erosion reflects structural imbalance: 60% liability growth vs 43% asset growth, driven primarily by debt financing.  <br>- Immediate priorities include curbing short-term debt reliance, optimizing inventory levels, and boosting cash reserves to restore liquidity buffers.

          - Debt-to-equity ratio increased 36% (3.59x to 4.89x) due to $8.99B debt growth, including $750M 5.0% 2026 notes and $1B 4.5% 2027 notes  <br>- Equity ratio fell 4.7 percentage points (21.7% to 17%) as assets grew $14.5B while equity only increased $88.3M  <br>- Debt-to-asset ratio rose 5 percentage points (78% to 83%) from debt-funded $3.265B facility expansions like Boston R&D center  <br>- Operating cash flow dropped 44% ($7.59B to $4.24B) while capital expenditures nearly doubled ($1.85B to $3.45B), requiring debt financing  <br>- Strategic debt issuance at 3.37% weighted-average rate supported growth/acquisitions despite increasing financial leverage risks  <br>- Interest coverage ratio remained uncalculable both years due to missing interest expense disclosure  <br>- Total debt reached $25.23B (2023) with $14.5B asset growth primarily financed through liabilities rather than equity  <br>- Lease commitments for new facilities contributed to long-term debt structure while maintaining fixed-rate cost control

          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) increased from 219 days (2022) to 261 days (2023), driven by slower collections (DSO up 9 days to 97.3), inventory turnover delays (DIO up 60.8 days to 297.8), and extended supplier payment terms (DPO up 27.7 days to 134.0).  <br>- Slower DSO reflects potential customer payment delays or relaxed credit terms, while DIO surge aligns with inventory value increase from $4,309.7M to $5,772.8M, suggesting overstocking or sales slowdown.  <br>- Longer DPO indicates improved cash retention via negotiated supplier terms but insufficient to offset working capital inefficiencies from receivables/inventory challenges.  <br>- Inventory buildup may relate to preparations for future demand or production delays, supported by investments in new manufacturing facilities.  <br>- New ERP system implementation post-2023 could influence future financial management efficiency.  <br>- Rising CCC signals increased working capital needs and liquidity risks despite higher cash reserves, requiring operational adjustments.

        Eli Lilly's earnings per share are expected to decrease next year due to rising expenses outpacing revenue growth, increased debt levels, and declining profitability margins. Despite revenue increases, higher costs in R&D, marketing, and administrative areas, along with growing short-term borrowings, are expected to continue pressuring net income, leading to a potential decline in EPS.
