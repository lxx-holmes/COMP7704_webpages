        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross margin ratio improved from 33.0% (2021) to 33.3% (2022) due to reduced production costs, freight expenses, and distribution network efficiencies.  <br>- Operating profit margin increased from 10.77% to 12.56%, driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses and operational cost controls.  <br>- Net profit margin rose from 6.51% to 8.77% as higher gross margins and disciplined expense management offset tax and interest obligations.  <br>- ROA improved from 12.48% to 18.9% through better inventory management, reduced shrinkage, and optimized asset utilization.  <br>- ROE plummeted from 406.3% to -175.3% due to negative equity caused by aggressive stock repurchases, deferred revenue adjustments, and potential debt-related losses.  <br>- Negative equity in 2022 stemmed from $14.3 billion in common stock buybacks, deferred revenue recognition timing, and self-insurance liability adjustments based on actuarial assumptions.  <br>- Deferred revenue (e.g., stored-value cards, protection plans) impacted equity by delaying recognition until performance obligations were met.  <br>- Vendor fund accounting complexities risked misclassification of rebates/discounts, potentially affecting gross margin and inventory valuation accuracy.  <br>- Self-insurance liabilities increased, with claim accruals tied to actuarial estimates, introducing volatility to expenses and equity.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio decreased from 1.19x (2021) to 1.02x (2022) due to current liabilities rising from $18,730M to $19,668M and reduced current assets, indicating tighter short-term coverage.  <br>- Quick ratio fell sharply from 0.33x to 0.12x as merchandise inventory increased from $16,193M to $17,605M while cash reserves declined, reducing liquid asset coverage.  <br>- Cash ratio dropped from 0.25x to 0.06x with cash equivalents plunging from $4,690M to $1,133M, exacerbated by $13,074M stock repurchases and lower operating cash flows ($11,049M to $10,113M).  <br>- Liquidity decline reflects increased inventory dependence (less liquid assets) and higher liabilities, signaling working capital inefficiencies and urgent need for improved cash management or financing.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio turned negative in 2022 ($49,456M liabilities / -$4,816M equity) due to $8.7 billion share repurchases (ASR program) and $4.0 billion new debt issuance, signaling severe financial distress.  <br>- 2021 Debt-to-Equity ratio was 31.5 ($45,298M liabilities / $1,437M equity), reflecting high leverage even before 2022‚Äôs equity erosion.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio improved to 13.67 in 2022 (EBIT $12,093M / interest $885M), indicating strong short-term interest obligation capacity despite solvency risks.  <br>- Total liabilities increased by $4,158M (2021: $45,298M; 2022: $49,456M), driven by debt financing and adjustments to lease obligations.  <br>- Equity plummeted from $1,437M (2021) to -$4,816M (2022), primarily from aggressive share buybacks reducing retained earnings.  <br>- Solvency Ratio shifted from 31.5 (2021) to negative (2022), reflecting insolvency risk as liabilities overwhelmed equity.  <br>- Store closing lease obligations contributed marginally to liability management, with slight reductions via terminations.  <br>- Despite stable interest coverage, negative equity and rising debt levels indicate deteriorating long-term financial stability.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increased slightly from 3.8 days (2021) to 4 days (2022), reflecting minor collection delays despite efficient accounts receivable management using "Other current assets" as a proxy.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) rose from 98.4 to 100 days due to merchandise return reserves and commodity price volatility, with inventory growing from $16,193M to $17,605M.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) decreased from 66.1 to 64.5 days as supplier financing programs expanded, reducing payment periods despite $3.0 billion in outstanding obligations (2022).  <br>- Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) extended from 36.1 to 39.5 days, driven by higher DIO/DSO partially offset by lower DPO; overall working capital efficiency remained strong.  <br>- Net sales increased from $89,597M (2021) to $96,250M (2022), contributing to inventory buildup needs and longer turnover periods.  <br>- Accounts payable grew from $10,884M to $11,354M, reflecting strategic use of supplier financing to manage cash flow.  <br>- Analysis limitations: Accounts receivable approximated via "Other current assets"; average inventory proxied by ending inventory due to data constraints.

        Despite strong revenue and profit growth, Lowe's faces significant financial health challenges, including increased debt, negative equity, and declining liquidity and solvency ratios. These factors, coupled with external risks like supply chain disruptions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, pose substantial risks that could lead to a decrease in earnings per share (EPS) next year.
