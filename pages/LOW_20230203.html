          - No significant changes (greater than ¬±5%) in percentage of total revenue composition between recent years.  <br>- Income from operations decreased 16.0% ($12,093 to $10,159); net income fell 23.75% ($8,442 to $6,437).  <br>- Total assets declined 2.1% ($44,640 to $43,708), driven by property (-2.5% as % of assets) and operating lease assets (-1.1%).  <br>- Merchandise inventory increased +3.2% as % of assets (39.3% to 42.5%).  <br>- Liabilities surged 17.1% ($49,456 to $57,962) with long-term debt up +6.3% (53.5% to 59.8% of liabilities/equity).  <br>- Income taxes payable increased +5.6% (2.9% to 8.5% of liabilities/equity) while accounts payable decreased -1.7%.  <br>- Shareholders' deficit worsened 196.3% (-$4,816 to -$14,254), reflecting declining net worth.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross Margin Ratio declined slightly (33.2% in 2023 vs 33.3% in 2022) due to higher production/procurement costs, indicating stable but less efficient cost management.  <br>- Operating Margin Ratio decreased significantly (10.47% vs 12.56%) from increased SG&A expenses like payroll and advertising, highlighting operational inefficiencies.  <br>- Net Profit Margin fell (6.63% vs 8.77%) as higher non-operating expenses (interest, taxes) reduced net earnings relative to sales.  <br>- Return on Assets dropped (14.7% vs 18.9%) reflecting less efficient asset utilization, partially linked to the Canadian retail business sale.  <br>- Return on Equity remained negative (-45.2% vs -175.3%) due to shareholders' deficit, showing financial distress despite slight improvement from debt management.  <br>- Debt-to-Equity Ratio improved but stayed negative (-4.07 vs -10.26), indicating reduced debt relative to negative equity while maintaining precarious financial position.  <br>- Overall profitability erosion across margins and returns underscores challenges in cost efficiency, with critical financial distress from negative equity requiring expense reduction and asset optimization.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved from 1.02x (2022) to 1.10x (2023), reflecting better working capital management through increased current assets or reduced liabilities.  <br>- Quick ratio rose from 0.71x to 0.89x, indicating enhanced ability to meet obligations without inventory sales, likely due to asset sales or reduced inventory reliance.  <br>- Cash ratio slightly increased (0.06x to 0.07x), remaining low; reliance on other liquid assets or credit facilities persists.  <br>- Inventory levels rose, possibly preparing for future demand or supply chain adjustments, aligning assets with liabilities despite tying up resources.  <br>- Current liabilities decreased slightly, contributing to ratio improvements without significantly impacting cash reserves.  <br>- Overall liquidity improved through effective current asset/liability management and inventory strategy, though cash reserves remain limited, necessitating monitoring.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio worsened from 10.26x (2022) to 4.07x (2023) due to a $8.5B liability increase ($9.8B new debt issuance) and equity deficit deepening from -$4.8B to -$14.3B from share repurchases ($5.3B) and $2.1B asset impairments.  <br>- Interest coverage ratio declined from 13.67x (2022) to 9.05x (2023) as operating income fell 16% to $10.2B, while interest expense rose 27% ($1.1B) from higher debt levels and 5.8% rates on new notes.  <br>- Shareholders' deficit tripled in 2023 (-$14.3B vs. -$4.8B in 2022) driven by aggressive capital returns ($5.3B buybacks) and impairment charges, weakening solvency despite 9x interest coverage remaining above immediate risk thresholds.  <br>- Total liabilities grew 17.2% YoY to $58B in 2023, with $9.8B unsecured notes issued in 2022 increasing leverage, while negative equity amplified debt-to-equity ratio distortions.  <br>- Operating income decreased to $10.2B (2023) from $12.1B (2022), reducing cash flow capacity to service higher interest costs linked to rising rates on new debt issuances.  <br>- Solvency ratios became less meaningful due to negative equity but highlighted deteriorating trends, with 2023 liabilities/equity at 4.07x vs. 10.26x in 2022, reflecting accelerated equity erosion.  <br>- Key drivers included debt-funded capital structure changes (new issuances), shareholder returns via buybacks, and operational underperformance (lower income, impairments), compounding leverage risks.

          - DSO increased from 3.98 days (2022) to 4.43 days (2023), indicating slower receivables collection due to extended payment terms or economic pressures, despite remaining efficient overall.  <br>- DIO rose from 100.0 days (2022) to 101.6 days (2023), reflecting slower inventory turnover linked to inventory shrinkage and adjustments in obsolete inventory reserves.  <br>- DPO decreased from 64.4 days (2022) to 59.3 days (2023), showing faster supplier payments potentially straining cash flow, influenced by revised payment terms or one-time factors.  <br>- CCC increased from 39.58 days (2022) to 46.73 days (2023), driven by higher DIO and lower DPO, signaling reduced cash efficiency.  <br>- Inventory management challenges and accelerated supplier payments highlight the need for operational adjustments to optimize cash flow.

        The prediction is based on the analysis of Lowe's financial statements, which show a decrease in net earnings, operating income, and key profitability ratios. The significant increase in expenses, higher debt levels, and worsening shareholders' deficit are concerning factors that suggest a decline in future earnings per share.
