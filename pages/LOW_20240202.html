          - Total revenue decreased by 11.0% ($97,059 to $86,377), and gross profit declined 10.57% ($32,257 to $28,844), while income from operations rose 13.9% ($10,159 to $11,557) and net income grew 20.0% ($6,437 to $7,726).  <br>- Merchandise inventory decreased 2.0% (42.4% to 40.4% of total assets), and cash equivalents declined 0.88% (3.08% to 2.20%), contributing to a 3.39% reduction in total current assets (49.04% to 45.65%).  <br>- Property/assets increased 2.07% (40.18% to 42.25%), while short-term borrowings fell to 0% (from 1.14%) and accounts payable decreased 3.27% (24.08% to 20.81%).  <br>- Long-term debt rose 9.45% (75.20% to 84.65%), increasing total liabilities by 3.3% (132.7% to 136.0%), while total current liabilities dropped 7.38% (44.63% to 37.25%).  <br>- Accumulated deficit worsened by 3.4% (-34.0% to -37.4%), and total shareholders‚Äô deficit increased 3.33% (-32.67% to -36.00%).  <br>- Year-over-year balance sheet changes for total assets (-4.37%), liabilities (-1.93%), and equity (-5.59%) were below ¬±10% thresholds, showing no significant movements.  <br>- Income taxes payable decreased 2.62% (2.70% to 0.08%), reflecting reduced tax obligations.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross margin ratio improved from 33.2% (2023) to 33.4% (2024) due to production cost management and inventory control, supported by merchandise inventory decreasing from $18.5B to $16.9B and cost of sales reduction from $64.8B to $57.5B.  <br>- Operating profit margin increased from 10.5% to 13.4% driven by reduced SG&A expenses ($20.3B to $15.6B), including lower advertising costs ($869M to $831M).  <br>- Net profit margin rose from 6.6% to 8.9% due to higher net earnings ($6.4B to $7.7B) and tax management, including Hurricane Ian-related deferred tax relief.  <br>- ROA improved from 14.7% to 18.5% as total assets decreased from $21.4B to $19.1B while net earnings increased.  <br>- ROE remained negative due to shareholders' deficit from $6.1B share repurchases in 2024, despite profitability improvements.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved from 1.10 (2023) to 1.24 (2024) due to Canadian business divestiture reducing liabilities and enhanced current asset management, strengthening liquidity.  <br>- Quick ratio declined slightly from 0.15 to 0.14, reflecting reduced liquid assets relative to liabilities as merchandise inventory dropped $1.638B, indicating tighter liquidity excluding inventory.  <br>- Cash ratio decreased from 0.088 to 0.079 as cash reserves fell $427M due to $6.138B share repurchases, $2.531B dividends, and capital expenditures, despite $8.14B operating cash flow.  <br>- Inventory reduction of $1.638B suggests improved management or slower sales, aligning with quick ratio decline and requiring monitoring for sales trends.  <br>- Significant cash outflows included $6.138B for share buybacks and $2.531B for dividends, partially offset by $2.983B new debt issuance, impacting cash reserves.  <br>- Stable liquidity overall with stronger current ratio, but declining quick/cash ratios highlight risks from aggressive shareholder returns and inventory shifts needing ongoing assessment.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio improved slightly from -4.07x (2023) to -3.78x (2024) due to a $1.1B liability reduction and increased shareholders' deficit (-$14,254M to -$15,050M), reflecting persistent negative equity.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio declined from 9.05x (2023) to 8.36x (2024) as interest expense rose 23% ($1,123M to $1,382M) from $3B new debt issuance, outpacing 14% EBIT growth ($10,159M to $11,557M).  <br>- Solvency Ratio remained negative (-4.07 in 2023 vs. -3.78 in 2024) due to $796M increase in shareholders' deficit, driven by $6.1B share repurchases and dividend payments in 2023.  <br>- Total liabilities decreased by $1.1B (2023: $57,962M to 2024: $56,845M), but debt maturities of $2.255B due in 2028 and $4.4B through 2028 require proactive refinancing management.  <br>- Negative equity position worsened despite slight liability reduction, with comprehensive income impacts and capital returns (buybacks/dividends) reducing retained earnings.  <br>- Interest coverage remains strong (8.36x) but declining trend signals pressure from rising debt costs, requiring monitoring of future EBIT growth vs. interest obligations.  <br>- Management faces solvency risks from $56.8B liabilities against -$15B equity, necessitating potential debt reduction or equity issuance to stabilize capital structure.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) increased from 104 days (2023) to 107 days (2024), indicating slower inventory turnover due to potential overstocking or reduced sales velocity.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) remained stable at 4 days in both years, reflecting consistent receivables collection efficiency with no material changes.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) decreased from 59 days (2023) to 55 days (2024), suggesting faster supplier payments that may strain liquidity or supplier relationships despite short-term cash flow benefits.  <br>- Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) worsened from 50 days (2023) to 56 days (2024), driven by higher DIO and reduced DPO, signaling less efficient working capital management.  <br>- Slower inventory turnover contributes to higher holding costs and operational inefficiencies, requiring improved inventory control strategies.  <br>- Faster supplier payments, while reducing payables duration, may pressure short-term liquidity and necessitate rebalancing payables terms.  <br>- The 6-day CCC increase underscores the need for coordinated optimization of inventory turnover and payables management to shorten the cash cycle.

        Despite improvements in operating and net income, Lowe's faces significant challenges with negative equity and high debt levels. The worsened cash conversion cycle and lower cash position could impact future liquidity. While share repurchases might temporarily boost EPS, the underlying financial instability suggests a potential decrease in earnings per share next year.
