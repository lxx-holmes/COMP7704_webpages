          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin declined from 46.0% (2021) to 44.6% (2022) due to 13% higher operating expenses (personnel, travel, FX losses) and increased income tax expense ($1,802M vs. $1,620M).  <br>- Operating Profit Margin improved from 53.4% to 55.2% driven by 22% revenue growth outpacing 13% operating cost increases, with operating income rising to $12,264M (2022) vs. $10,082M (2021).  <br>- ROA increased from 23.0% to 25.6% as net revenue grew 18% while total assets remained stable ($28,540M vs. $28,422M), reflecting enhanced asset utilization.  <br>- ROE surged from 117.7% to 156.3% due to higher net income ($9,930M vs. $8,687M), lower equity ($6,460M vs. $7,454M from share repurchases), and increased debt evidenced by interest expense rising to $471M (2022) from $431M (2021).  <br>- Debt levels raised caution despite operational efficiency gains, with total equity reduction and leverage contributing to ROE expansion.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 1.29 (2021) to 1.17 (2022) due to $343M decrease in current assets and $1,009M increase in current liabilities (accounts payable, accrued expenses, settlement obligations).  <br>- Cash ratio fell from 0.56 (2021) to 0.50 (2022) as cash/cash equivalents decreased by $413M while current liabilities rose, with restricted cash balances tied to collateral obligations.  <br>- Net cash from operations increased to $11,195M (2022) but was offset by $10,328M financing outflows (including $8,753M treasury stock purchases and $1,903M dividends).  <br>- Current assets dropped from $16,949M (2021) to $16,606M (2022), while cash reserves declined from $7,421M to $7,008M despite operational cash growth.  <br>- Quick ratio assumptions remained unchanged (no inventory data), likely mirroring current ratio trends.  <br>- Liquidity position weakened but remains stable (current ratio >1), requiring closer working capital monitoring amid rising liabilities.  <br>- Increased transaction volumes drove higher short-term obligations, while cash flow management prioritized shareholder returns over liquidity buffers.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio increased from 4.10 (2021) to 5.09 (2022) due to ‚Ç¨750 million senior notes and $275 million INR term loan issuances, reflecting higher debt reliance and financial leverage.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio improved slightly from 23.9 (2021) to 24.9 (2022) driven by EBIT growth from operational efficiency and revenue increases, enhancing debt service capacity.  <br>- Total debt rose through strategic financing activities, including unsecured debt instruments for general corporate purposes, while maintaining flexible repayment terms (e.g., INR Term Loan with no financial covenants).  <br>- Increased leverage was offset by stronger earnings performance, balancing growth investments (via debt) with maintained solvency through improved profit generation.  <br>- Company prioritized debt management alongside hedging activities, as evidenced by structured note issuances and discretionary prepayment options to optimize financial flexibility.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved by 5 days (27 days in 2021 to 22 days in 2022), reflecting enhanced working capital efficiency through better receivables/payables management and cash retention.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) decreased by 2 days (58 to 56 days), driven by faster receivables collection from optimized processes, payment terms, and revenue recognition policies tied to transaction timing.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) increased by 3 days (31 to 34 days), indicating extended supplier payment timelines due to improved negotiation or payable management, retaining cash longer.  <br>- $11.2 billion net cash from operating activities in 2022 (per cash flow statement) underscores strengthened liquidity from these efficiency gains.  <br>- Revenue recognition policy (recognized when services are transferred) aligns with DSO improvements, accelerating collections.  <br>- Combined CCC components (DSO + Days Inventory Outstanding - DPO) suggest reduced working capital cycle despite undisclosed inventory metrics.  <br>- Operational efficiency focus supports liquidity, with slower supplier payments and faster customer collections optimizing cash flow.

        Mastercard has shown consistent growth in revenue, operating income, and net income over the past three years. The improvement in operating profit margin and return on assets, along with effective debt management, suggests continued financial strength. Despite a slight decline in net profit margin, the overall positive trends in revenue growth and operational efficiency support the expectation of increased earnings per share next year.
