        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 5.05 (2020) to 3.16 (2021), driven by increased current liabilities (accrued expenses up $3,357M, accounts payable up $1,436M) and reduced cash from share repurchases.  <br>- Quick ratio mirrored current ratio decline (5.05 to 3.16), showing reduced liquid asset coverage despite remaining above 1.  <br>- Cash ratio fell below 1 (1.173 to 0.785), indicating insufficient cash reserves to cover current liabilities due to $50,728M financing outflows (including $44,810M share repurchases).  <br>- DSO improved from 47.9 to 44.6 days, reflecting enhanced receivables collection efficiency.  <br>- Operating cash flow increased to $57,683M (2021), demonstrating strong operational performance.  <br>- $7,570M used in investing activities focused on property/equipment acquisitions.  <br>- Liquidity decline occurred despite robust operating cash flow, primarily due to aggressive capital returns ($44.8B share buybacks) and tax payments for RSU settlements ($5,515M).  <br>- Total cash reserves decreased significantly from financing activities, impacting cash-based liquidity metrics.  <br>- Non-cash current assets now represent a larger portion of liquidity coverage compared to prior year.  <br>- Improved receivables management partially offsets liquidity pressures from liability growth and cash outflows.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased from 0.24 (2020) to 0.33 (2021), reflecting higher reliance on debt financing for strategic initiatives or share buybacks, raising financial leverage and risk.  <br>- Solvency ratio (Total Liabilities/Equity) rose from 0.24 to 0.33, driven by reduced equity and increased debt, though remaining below 1, indicating stability.  <br>- Total equity declined from $128,290M (2020) to $124,879M (2021), partly due to $44,810M in share buybacks reducing equity levels despite $39,370M net income.  <br>- Share buybacks prioritized over equity growth redirected funds from positive net income, amplifying leverage despite profitability.  <br>- Increased leverage signals strategic debt use for activities like buybacks, requiring monitoring to balance financial stability and shareholder returns.
