          - Current ratio improved from 2.20 (2022) to 2.67 (2023) due to 184% cash increase ($14.7B to $41.9B) and current liabilities rising moderately ($27.0B to $32.0B).  <br>- Cash ratio surged from 0.54 to 1.31 as cash reserves grew faster than liabilities, supported by $71.1B operating cash flow (up from $50.5B in 2022).  <br>- Quick ratio calculation remained unfeasible both years due to missing inventory data.  <br>- Liquidity strengthened despite $467M spent on acquisitions, as operating cash inflows significantly exceeded investment outflows.  <br>- Current asset growth (184% cash increase) outpaced current liability growth (18% rise), maintaining healthy short-term coverage.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased from 0.48 (2022) to 0.5 (2023) due to $8.5B senior unsecured notes issuance and equity reduction from share repurchases.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio declined from 231.55 to 69.1 as interest expense surged from $160M to $420M from higher-rate debt, despite operating income growth.  <br>- Long-term Debt/Total Assets rose from 5.3% to 8% as debt grew from $9.923B to $18.385B through new issuances for share buybacks and corporate needs, outpacing asset growth.  <br>- Leverage remains moderate with debt at 8% of total assets, maintaining healthy asset-liability coverage despite increased borrowing.  <br>- Solvency position stays strong overall, but requires monitoring of rising interest costs and debt levels.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO increased from 42.1 days (2022) to 43.7 days (2023), reflecting slower receivables collection due to geopolitical risks, supply chain disruptions, and international expansion complexities.  <br>- DPO improved from 72.1 days (2022) to 68.2 days (2023), driven by renegotiated supplier terms and enhanced cash flow management.  <br>- CCC remains uncalculable for both years due to missing DIO data, limiting full working capital efficiency assessment.  <br>- Supply chain disruptions and inventory risks (rapid product cycles, fluctuating demand) indirectly impacted payment terms and delivery timelines, affecting DSO/DPO.  <br>- Global operations introduced challenges in managing receivables/payables across regions, contributing to DSO increase.  <br>- Acquisitions and strategic transactions required resource allocation for integration, potentially diverting focus from receivables/payables optimization.  <br>- Lower CCC (if calculable) would indicate improved working capital efficiency, but partial data restricts conclusive analysis.

        Based on the analysis of Meta Platforms, Inc.'s financial statements, the company has shown consistent growth in revenue, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) over the past three years. The improvement in profitability margins, strong cash position, and effective management of operating expenses all indicate a positive outlook. While there are factors to monitor, such as the slight increase in days sales outstanding and long-term debt, the overall trends suggest that EPS will continue to grow next year.
