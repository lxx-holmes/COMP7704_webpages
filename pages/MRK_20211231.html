        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin increased from 17.0% (2020) to 26.77% (2021) due to higher sales ($41.5B to $48.7B) and lower total costs/expenses ($35.7B to $34.8B), reflecting improved cost control.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin rose from 67.2% to 72.0% as sales growth outpaced modest cost of sales increases, indicating effective production cost management.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin surged from 14.1% to 28.5% driven by reduced operating expenses (53.1% to 43.5% of sales) and higher other income.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) improved from 7.7% to 12.3% as net income from continuing operations grew 173% ($4.5B to $12.3B), outpacing asset growth.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) increased from 27.8% to 34.1% due to net income growth exceeding equity expansion, demonstrating efficient capital utilization.  <br>- Operating Expense Ratio decreased from 53.1% to 43.5%, highlighting streamlined operations and reduced administrative/R&D spending.  <br>- Organon & Co. spin-off contributed to cost reductions, operational focus on high-margin products, and improved expense management.  <br>- Revenue recognition timing adjustments and optimized expense allocation further enhanced profitability metrics across all ratios.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved from 1.02 (2020) to 1.27 (2021) driven by $2,427M rise in accounts receivable, $2,313M increase in other current assets, and $4,019M reduction in loans payable/current debt.  <br>- Quick ratio increased from 0.81 to 1.02 (2020-2021) due to higher liquid assets (receivables, other assets) and $4,019M debt repayment, with slight trade payable/accrued liability reductions.  <br>- Operating cash flow surged to $13,122M in 2021 (vs. $7,617M in 2020), though insufficient data prevented operating cash flow ratio calculation.  <br>- Inventories rose slightly, suggesting preparation for future demand or new product launches.  <br>- Acquisitions (e.g., Acceleron Pharma) were supported by $3,097M from financing activities (debt issuance/stock options), offsetting cash outflows.  <br>- Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased slightly, reflecting improved liability management.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-equity ratio improved from 2.60 (2020) to 1.76 (2021) due to $8.0 billion senior notes issuance (partially used to repay short-term debt) and Organon spin-off transferring $9.5 billion debt.  <br>- Long-term debt to total assets ratio increased modestly from 27.7% (2020) to 29% (2021) from new debt issuance, offset by asset growth from property/equipment investments and intangible assets.  <br>- Organon spin-off (June 2021) removed $9.5 billion debt from Merck's balance sheet and provided $9.0 billion cash proceeds, enhancing solvency while reducing liabilities.  <br>- Strategic debt management included using 2021 debt proceeds for ESG-aligned projects, commercial paper repayment, and general operations, balancing leverage with growth initiatives.  <br>- Interest coverage ratio analysis was limited due to unavailable explicit interest expense data in financial statements.  <br>- Total asset growth from investments partially mitigated the impact of increased long-term debt, maintaining moderate leverage despite higher absolute debt levels.

          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) increased from 93 days (2020) to 105 days (2021), indicating less efficient working capital management.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) rose from 60 to 69 days due to accounts receivable increasing from $6.8B to $9.2B, despite $2.8B in factoring agreements (up from $2.1B in 2020).  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) increased from 149 to 159 days, driven by inventory growth from $7.6B to $8.1B, with higher raw materials and work-in-process inventories classified as "Other assets."  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) increased from 116 to 123 days, reflecting extended supplier payment terms for cash conservation, though risking supplier relationship strain.  <br>- Stable cash reserves ($8.05B in 2020 vs. $8.1B in 2021) masked underlying inefficiencies in receivables and inventory turnover.  <br>- Slower collections (DSO) and inventory movement (DIO) offset benefits from delayed payables (DPO), reducing overall cash flow efficiency.  <br>- Recommendations include improving inventory management and receivables processes to shorten the CCC and enhance liquidity.
