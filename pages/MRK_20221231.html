          - Net profit margin decreased from 26.8% (2021) to 24.5% (2022) due to $3.8B Cost of Sales and $1.3B R&D increases outpacing $10B sales growth, with higher provisions for discounts/rebates.  <br>- Gross profit margin improved from 34.3% to 35.4% through better production efficiency and economies of scale, supported by increased Property/Plant/Equipment investments.  <br>- Operating profit margin slightly declined from 28.3% to 27.8% as $408M SG&A and R&D expense growth offset gross margin gains, reflecting strategic investments.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) rose from 12.3% to 13.3% as net income growth (+$1.47B) exceeded asset expansion, indicating improved asset utilization.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) fell from 34.1% to 31.5% due to equity growth outpacing net income, potentially from share issuance or retained earnings accumulation.  <br>- Return on Sales (ROS) declined from 26.8% to 24.5%, mirroring net profit margin trends due to disproportionate expense growth relative to sales.  <br>- Sales increased by ~$10B (48.7B to 59.3B) while net income grew less proportionally ($13.05B to $14.52B), compressing margins.  <br>- Mixed efficiency signals: ROA improvement contrasted with ROE decline, reflecting divergent asset/equity utilization outcomes.  <br>- Strategic R&D/marketing investments and temporary profitability impacts from increased rebate/discount provisions were noted in financial statement disclosures.

          - Current ratio improved from 1.27 (2021) to 1.47 (2022) as current assets grew $5.5B versus $0.37B liability increase, reflecting better asset-liability management.  <br>- Quick ratio rose from 1.02 to 1.21, supported by inventory reduction from $5,953M to $5,911M and stronger current asset growth.  <br>- Cash ratio doubled from 0.34 to 0.52 due to cash reserves increasing 57% ($8,096M to $12,694M), fueled by operating cash flow growth from $13,122M to $19,095M.  <br>- Inventory management improved with $161M reduction in 2022, enhancing liquidity quality by decreasing reliance on inventory for obligations.  <br>- Strategic liability management maintained balance despite acquisitions, as current asset growth ($30,266M to $35,722M) outpaced payable/accrued liability increases.  <br>- Major acquisitions (Acceleron Pharma, Pandion Therapeutics) were financed without liquidity strain, supported by $5.7B investment in Seagen offset by strong cash flows.  <br>- Operating cash flow surged 45% year-over-year ($13.1B to $19.1B), providing capital for both strategic investments and liquidity buffer expansion.  <br>- Accounts receivable and other current assets contributed to the $5.5B current asset increase, enhancing financial flexibility.  <br>- Trade payables and accrued liabilities rose moderately ($23,872M to $24,239M), demonstrating disciplined working capital management.  <br>- Cash equivalents represented 35.5% of total current assets in 2022 versus 26.7% in 2021, indicating a more liquid asset composition.

          - Debt-to-Equity ratio decreased from 1.76 (2021) to 1.37 (2022) due to reduced long-term debt ($30,690M to $28,745M) and increased stockholders' equity ($95,293M to $102,480M).  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio improved from 10.35x (2021) to 10.96x (2022) driven by higher EBIT ($13,879M to $16,444M) and lower interest expense ($1,341M to $1,501M), despite a typographical error in the direction of interest expense change.  <br>- Financial statement notes confirm debt reduction, equity growth, and improved EBIT, supporting Merck's enhanced solvency and ability to meet obligations.  <br>- Overall financial stability strengthened through a combination of deleveraging, equity accumulation, and earnings growth, reflecting reduced reliance on debt financing.

          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved from 105.2 days (2021) to 92.7 days (2022), driven by better working capital management.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) decreased from 69.1 to 58.2 days, reflecting faster receivables collection despite accounts receivable increasing slightly ($9,230M to $9,450M).  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) dropped from 159.7 to 123.9 days due to improved inventory turnover, supported by reduced inventory ($5,953M to $5,911M) and better sales-to-stock alignment.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) declined from 123.6 to 89.4 days as trade payables decreased ($4,609M to $4,264M), indicating faster supplier payments possibly from renegotiated terms.  <br>- Shorter CCC enhances cash flow efficiency but requires monitoring of supplier relationships due to reduced payment periods.  <br>- Balance sheet data and notes highlight operational focus on estimates, provisions, and working capital optimization as key drivers of improvements.

        Merck & Co.'s consistent sales growth, effective cost management, strong cash position, and improving profitability metrics suggest that the company is well-positioned for continued growth. The increase in cash and cash equivalents, along with efficient working capital management, provides the liquidity needed for investments in R&D and other growth opportunities. While there are risks such as potential margin pressures and the need for R&D investments to yield successful products, the overall trend indicates that EPS is likely to increase next year.
