          - R&D expenses surged from 22.85% to 50.80% of total revenue (27.95% increase), contributing to total costs rising from 72.26% to 96.83% (24.57% increase).  <br>- Income from continuing operations before taxes plummeted from 27.75% to 3.14% (24.61% decrease), with YoY decline of 88.45%.  <br>- Net income from continuing operations dropped from 24.49% to 0.63% (23.86% decrease); net income attributable to Merck fell similarly to 0.61%.  <br>- Cash and cash equivalents declined by 5.21% as a percentage of total assets, reflecting reduced liquidity.  <br>- Long-term debt increased by 5.23% relative to total liabilities & equity, indicating higher leverage.  <br>- Total stockholders' equity decreased by 18.28% YoY, with its proportion of total liabilities & equity falling 6.90%.  <br>- Profitability erosion occurred despite slight revenue growth, driven by disproportionate expense growth in R&D and operational costs.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin plummeted from 24.49% (2022) to 0.607% (2023) due to surging R&D expenses, restructuring costs, a $572.5M legal settlement, and an 80% effective tax rate.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin remained stable at 73.2% (2023 vs. 72.6% in 2022), supported by controlled cost of goods sold despite slight revenue growth to $60.115B.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin dropped sharply to 3.21% (2023) from 27.75% (2022) driven by $30.5B R&D expenses (up from $13.5B) and $599M restructuring costs (vs. $337M in 2022).  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) fell to 0.342% (2023 vs. 13.29% in 2022), reflecting reduced profit generation efficiency from assets amid higher expenses and tax impacts.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) declined to 0.97% (2023 vs. 31.53% in 2022), indicating inefficient equity utilization due to expense surges and tax rate increases.  <br>- Operating Expense Ratio increased to 69.95% (2023 vs. 42.88% in 2022) primarily from R&D investments in acquisitions (Prometheus, Imago) and collaborations (Daiichi Sankyo), plus higher restructuring/separation costs.  <br>- Effective tax rate surged to 80% (2023 vs. 11.7% in 2022) due to non-tax-deductible acquisition costs reducing domestic pretax income by ~$16.9B.  <br>- Revenue grew modestly to $60.115B (2023 vs. $59.283B in 2022), but profitability was offset by expense pressures and tax impacts.  <br>- Zetia antitrust litigation settlement created a one-time $572.5M charge in 2023, further reducing net income.  <br>- Restructuring costs rose to $599M (2023 vs. $337M in 2022) from facility shutdowns and manufacturing network optimizations.  <br>- R&D expenses doubled to $30.5B (2023) driven by business development activities, including acquisitions, collaborations, and higher compensation costs.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 1.47x (2022) to 1.25x (2023) due to reduced current assets ($35.7B‚Üí$32.2B) and increased current liabilities ($24.2B‚Üí$25.7B), weakening short-term obligation coverage.  <br>- Quick ratio fell from 1.23x to 1.01x, reflecting decreased liquid assets including cash ($12.7B‚Üí$6.8B) and short-term investments ($498M‚Üí$252M).  <br>- Cash ratio halved from 0.54x to 0.28x, driven by $5.85B cash reduction and $3B accounts receivable factoring that moved cash to restricted accounts.  <br>- Increased current liabilities included $25.7B (2023) from higher trade payables, accrued liabilities, and $2.1B contingent consideration linked to terminated Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture.  <br>- Factoring arrangements improved cash flow but restricted $3B receivables in other assets, failing to fully offset liquidity strain from operational cash declines.  <br>- Termination of Sanofi joint venture contributed to higher short-term obligations through contingent liabilities requiring future royalty payments.  <br>- Working capital management challenges emerged as reduced cash reserves (-46%) and asset liquidity coincided with rising payables and contractual obligations.

          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased from 1.15 (2022) to 1.58 (2023) due to $6.0 billion senior unsecured notes issued in May 2023 for Prometheus acquisition and debt repayment.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio declined sharply from 10.96 (2022) to 4.05 (2023) as commercial paper interest rates rose from 0.65% to 5.14%, increasing interest expenses.  <br>- Financial Leverage ratio rose from 48.5% (2022) to 55.6% (2023) reflecting higher debt reliance, driven by the $6.0 billion debt issuance and increased long-term borrowing.  <br>- Long-Term Debt-to-Total Assets ratio increased from 26.3% (2022) to 31.6% (2023) due to new long-term debt issuance, including the $6.0 billion senior notes.  <br>- Total liabilities grew significantly in 2023, with long-term debt representing 31.6% of assets versus 26.3% in 2022, signaling elevated financial risk from expanded leverage.  <br>- Higher interest rate environment in 2023 compounded solvency pressures, reducing earnings‚Äô capacity to cover interest obligations compared to 2022.

          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) increased by 25.3 days (118.1 days in 2023 vs. 92.8 days in 2022), driven by slower collections and inventory buildup.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) rose 4.6 days to 62.8 days due to extended payment terms (e.g., 90 days for Keytruda) and $3.0 billion factored receivables in 2023 not fully offsetting collection delays.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) increased 20.1 days to 144.1 days from strategic inventory buildup ($790 million allocated for 2023 product launches vs. $516 million in 2022) and higher LIFO adjustments.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) decreased marginally by 0.6 days to 88.8 days, reflecting slightly faster supplier payments with minimal CCC impact.  <br>- Accounts receivable balance grew from $9,450 million (2022) to $10,349 million (2023), aligning with DSO increase.  <br>- Inventory levels rose from $5,911 million (2022) to $6,358 million (2023), supporting DIO expansion.  <br>- Comprehensive income loss in 2023 (e.g., foreign exchange fluctuations) potentially strained cash flow efficiency.  <br>- Revenue recognition practices for vaccines sold to the U.S. government may influence cash flow timing but less directly impact CCC.

        The significant increase in R&D expenses and restructuring costs, coupled with a decline in profitability and cash reserves, suggests that Merck's EPS is likely to decrease next year. While R&D investments could lead to future growth, the immediate impact on EPS is negative.
