        While Moderna experienced significant growth in 2021 due to the success of Spikevax, the next year may see a decrease in EPS. This is due to potential stabilization or decline in COVID-19 vaccine demand, increased R&D expenses without immediate returns, and tougher year-over-year comparisons. The company's reliance on a single product and evolving pandemic dynamics contribute to this outlook.
