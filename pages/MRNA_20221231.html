          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved from 1.76 (2021) to 2.73 (2022) due to current liabilities decreasing more sharply ($9,128M to $4,923M) than current assets ($16,071M to $13,431M), driven by $4.2B deferred revenue reduction and $828M income taxes payable decline.  <br>- Quick ratio rose from 1.52 to 2.29 as accounts receivable decreased by $1.8B, reflecting enhanced liquidity without reliance on inventory/prepaid assets and improved cash collection efficiency.  <br>- Cash ratio surged from 1.17 to 2.01 supported by $5.0B operating cash flow despite significant investments/stock buybacks, strengthening immediate debt coverage capacity.  <br>- Working capital increased by $1.6B primarily from reduced deferred revenue (revenue recognition outpacing new deposits) and lower income tax obligations.  <br>- All liquidity ratios exceeding 1 demonstrate robust short-term stability, with current liability management and operational cash generation being key drivers of improvement.

        Moderna's earnings per share (EPS) are expected to decrease next year due to rising costs of sales and operating expenses, which outpaced modest revenue growth. The significant increases in R&D and SG&A expenses, coupled with a decline in gross and operating profit margins, indicate a challenging financial outlook. Unless the company achieves substantial revenue growth or significantly reduces expenses, EPS is likely to continue its downward trend.
