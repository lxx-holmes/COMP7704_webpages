          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross margin ratio decreased slightly from 68.9% (2021) to 68.4% (2022) due to 20% cost of revenue growth outpacing 18% revenue growth, reflecting higher production costs and pricing pressures.  <br>- Operating profit margin improved from 41.6% to 42.1% through effective expense management, with operating expenses growing 14% (slower than 18% revenue growth) despite cloud engineering investments.  <br>- Net profit margin increased from 36.4% to 36.7% driven by 19% net income growth, tax benefits, and disciplined cost control across operations.  <br>- ROA rose from 18.3% to 19.9% as net income growth (+19%) exceeded asset base expansion, supported by strategic investments in server/network equipment.  <br>- ROE improved marginally from 43.1% to 43.7% due to net income growth outweighing reduced stockholders' equity from share repurchases.  <br>- Microsoft Cloud revenue grew 32% year-over-year, with Intelligent Cloud segment bolstered by Nuance acquisition, enhancing high-margin service offerings.  <br>- Strategic focus on cloud services and optimized asset utilization contributed to overall profitability gains despite inflationary cost pressures.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 2.080 (2021) to 1.786 (2022) due to rising current liabilities ($88.7B to $95.1B) and reduced assets, though remaining above 1 indicates short-term obligation coverage ability.  <br>- Quick ratio dropped from 2.050 to 1.746, reflecting lower liquidity excluding inventories as cash/short-term investments fell from $130.3B to $104.8B.  <br>- Cash ratio decreased sharply from 1.469 to 1.101, driven by a $25.5B reduction in cash/short-term investments, directly impacting immediate liquidity relative to current liabilities.  <br>- Increased cash outflows: $10.4B rise in financing activities (including $5.3B stock repurchases and $5.3B debt repayments) and $2.7B more in investing activities, notably $13.1B additional acquisitions.  <br>- Strategic acquisitions like the $68.7B Activision Blizzard purchase (planned for 2023) tied up substantial cash resources, contributing to liquidity pressures.  <br>- All liquidity ratios remained above 1, maintaining ability to meet short-term obligations, but the cash ratio‚Äôs significant decline highlights need for proactive cash flow management.

          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio decreased from 1.35 (2021) to 1.19 (2022), reflecting reduced debt reliance driven by $24.5B equity growth versus $6.5B liability increase.  <br>- Solvency Ratio improved from 1.35 (2021) to 1.19 (2022) due to stronger equity expansion and controlled liability growth, enhancing liability management.  <br>- Financial Leverage Ratio declined from 2.35 (2021) to 2.19 (2022), signaling lower debt financing of assets as equity dilution reduced leverage.  <br>- Total Equity increased by $24.5B compared to a $6.5B rise in Total Liabilities, directly improving all solvency metrics.  <br>- Strategic investments, retained earnings growth, and prudent debt management supported equity expansion and financial stability.  <br>- Lower ratios across 2022 indicate reduced financial risk, improved long-term viability, and strengthened solvency position versus 2021.

          - DSO decreased from 82.6 days (2021) to 81.5 days (2022), reflecting marginally faster receivables collection through improved management practices or early payment incentives.  <br>- DIO increased from 18.4 days to 21.8 days due to slower inventory turnover, driven by a rise in finished goods inventories from $1,367M to $2,516M (potential stockpiling or sales slowdowns).  <br>- DPO extended from 105.9 days to 110.8 days, indicating strategic use of supplier credit to enhance cash flow by delaying payments.  <br>- CCC improved from -5.1 days to -7.5 days, showing increased working capital efficiency via extended payables financing operations beyond receivables collection and inventory turnover periods.  <br>- Negative CCC highlights effective reliance on supplier credit but raises concerns about inventory management risks, including potential obsolescence from slower turnover.
