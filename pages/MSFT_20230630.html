          - Cost of Revenue decreased by 0.4% (31.6% to 31.2% of total revenue), contributing to a 0.4% Gross Profit increase (68.4% to 68.8%).  <br>- Research and Development expenses rose 0.5% (12.4% to 12.9%) and General and Administrative expenses increased 0.6% (3.0% to 3.6%) as a percentage of revenue.  <br>- Net Income percentage declined 2.5% (36.7% to 34.2%) despite a 6.9% Total Revenue growth ($198,270M to $211,915M) and 7.7% Gross Profit increase ($135,620M to $146,052M).  <br>- Operating Income grew 6.0% ($83,383M to $88,523M), but Net Income decreased 0.5% ($72,738M to $72,361M) year-over-year.  <br>- Provision for Income Taxes surged 2.5% (5.5% to 8.0% of revenue), significantly impacting net profitability.  <br>- Short-term investments as a percentage of total assets fell 6.31% (24.89% to 18.58%) between 2022 and 2023.  <br>- Total Assets grew 12.93% ($364,840M to $411,976M), while Total Shareholders‚Äô Equity increased 23.85% ($166,542M to $206,223M).

        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross margin ratio improved slightly (68.4% to 68.9%) due to high-margin cloud services growth (Azure) and reduced depreciation from revised server equipment accounting estimates.  <br>- Operating profit margin declined (42.1% to 41.7%) as 10% operating expense growth from cloud engineering investments, severance costs, and acquisitions (Nuance, Xandr) outpaced revenue increases.  <br>- Net profit margin decreased (36.7% to 34.1%) primarily from a $1.2B Q2 charge (severance/impairment costs), higher taxes, and absence of prior-year tax benefits.  <br>- ROA declined (19.9% to 17.5%) due to lower net income from one-time charges and capital-intensive datacenter/server capacity investments reducing asset efficiency.  <br>- ROE dropped sharply (43.7% to 35.1%) from reduced net income and increased stockholders' equity diluting returns.  <br>- Revenue grew 7% driven by Intelligent Cloud (+17%) and Productivity/Business Processes segments, offset by More Personal Computing declines.  <br>- Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted both revenue growth and expense structures.  <br>- Operating expenses rose 10% due to strategic investments, severance packages, and acquisition-related costs.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio decreased slightly from 1.79 (2022) to 1.77 (2023) as current liabilities rose to $104,149M (from $95,082M), outpacing current assets' growth to $184,257M (from $169,684M).  <br>- Quick ratio declined marginally from 1.75 to 1.74, reflecting a $1.24B inventory reduction to $2,500M (from $3,742M), indicating improved management or reduced demand.  <br>- Cash ratio improved from 1.10 to 1.07 despite numerical decrease, driven by a 149% surge in cash and equivalents to $34,704M (from $13,931M), strengthening short-term liquidity.  <br>- Cash and equivalents increased significantly to $34,704M (from $13,931M), enhancing liquidity, while inventory reduction to $2,500M (from $3,742M) suggests operational efficiency.  <br>- Overall liquidity remains robust with stable current/quick ratios and a strengthened cash position, supported by effective working capital management.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio improved from 1.19 (2022) to 1.00 (2023) as equity rose from $166,542M to $206,223M, driven by $72,361M 2023 net income and a $3.0B net income boost from extending server/network equipment depreciation lives (4 to 6 years).  <br>- Solvency Ratio improved from 1.19 (2022) to 1.00 (2023), reflecting stability as liabilities matched equity, supported by retained earnings growth from $57,055M (2021) to $118,848M (2023).  <br>- Accounting change increased 2023 operating income by $3.7B and net income by $3.0B, directly contributing to equity growth.  <br>- Operating cash flow of $87,582M (2023) strengthened profitability and debt management capabilities, further enhancing financial stability.  <br>- Total liabilities grew modestly from $198,298M (2022) to $205,753M (2023), while equity expanded significantly, reducing leverage.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO increased from 80 to 83 days in 2023, indicating slower receivables collection partially due to higher unearned revenue ($5,109M to $5,535M) recognizing revenue before cash collection.  <br>- DIO improved sharply from 22 to 11 days, reflecting optimized inventory management via net realizable value adjustments and supply chain efficiency.  <br>- DPO decreased from 91 to 80 days, suggesting accelerated supplier payments potentially tied to rising other current liabilities ($2,272M to $4,149M).  <br>- CCC worsened from 11 to 14 days as DSO/DPO erosion offset inventory gains, with shareholder capital returns (dividends/repurchases) and cloud/AI investments impacting cash flow dynamics.  <br>- Inventory turnover benefited from proactive quantity reviews and demand forecasting enhancements despite stable cost valuation methods.  <br>- Unearned revenue growth and altered customer payment terms contributed to receivables collection delays despite higher recognized revenue.  <br>- Supplier payment speed changes may reflect renegotiated terms or cash preservation strategies amid increased short-term obligations.  <br>- Overall cash efficiency decline highlights trade-offs between inventory optimization and working capital pressures from receivables/payables shifts.

        Despite revenue growth, the company's net income slightly decreased in 2023, and profitability margins such as operating and net profit margins have declined. The return on assets and equity has also decreased, indicating less efficient use of resources. While the company's solvency position has improved, the current trends in profitability suggest that earnings per share may decrease next year unless cost management and operational efficiency improve.
