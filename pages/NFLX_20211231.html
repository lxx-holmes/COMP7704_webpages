          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin increased from 11.0% (2020) to 17.2% (2021) due to net income growing 85% YoY (from $2.76B to $5.12B) outpacing revenue growth.  <br>- Operating profit margin rose from 18.3% to 20.8% as operating income grew 35% (from $4.59B to $6.19B) faster than revenues.  <br>- ROA improved from 7.0% to 11.5% through better asset utilization, with net income doubling while total assets remained stable.  <br>- ROE surged from 25.0% to 32.3%, reflecting $5.12B net income in 2021 driving enhanced shareholder returns through efficient equity use.  <br>- Gross profit margin expanded from 38.7% to 41.7% despite COGS increasing 13% ($15.28B to $17.33B), indicating improved pricing power.  <br>- Operating expense ratio increased slightly from 33.4% to 34.6% due to rising marketing (+18%), technology (+13%), and administrative costs.  <br>- All profitability metrics except operating expenses improved, showing 2021 financial health gains through cost discipline and asset efficiency.  <br>- Higher ROE (32.3%) and net income ($5.12B) demonstrate strengthened capacity to generate shareholder value.  <br>- Stable asset base combined with income growth drove ROA improvement, suggesting optimized resource allocation.  <br>- Operating expense growth (34.6% of revenue) presents opportunity for tighter cost controls despite overall margin expansion.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 1.25 (2020) to 0.95 (2021), falling below 1 due to current liabilities increasing from $7,805,785K to $8,488,966K and reduced cash reserves.  <br>- Cash ratio dropped from 1.05 to 0.71 as cash/cash equivalents fell 27% ($8.2B to $6.0B), impacted by $500M debt repayment, $600M share buybacks, and $4.9B content investments.  <br>- Quick ratio could not be calculated due to missing inventory data, limiting assessment of liquid assets excluding inventory.  <br>- Operating cash flow plummeted 84% from $2,427,077K (2020) to $392,610K (2021), reducing capacity to meet short-term obligations.  <br>- Content spending surged 39% ($4.9B) in 2021, prioritizing long-term growth over immediate liquidity through increased production/acquisition costs.  <br>- Net income rose 85% ($2.8B to $5.1B), but profits were offset by cash outflows for strategic investments and capital activities.  <br>- Total current assets declined while liabilities grew, exacerbating liquidity strain despite improved profitability.  <br>- $1.1B cash used for debt repayment and share repurchases further reduced available liquidity reserves.  <br>- Ratios below 1 in 2021 signal heightened short-term financial risk despite higher net income, highlighting cash management challenges.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-equity ratio improved from 2.55 (2020) to 1.81 (2021) due to $916 million debt reduction ($16,309M to $15,393M) and increased stockholders' equity.  <br>- Interest coverage ratio rose from 5.97 (2020) to 8.09 (2021) as operating income grew 35% ($4.59B to $6.19B), outpacing interest expense increases.  <br>- Solvency ratio (total liabilities/equity) decreased from 2.55 to 1.81, reflecting improved leverage through equity growth and debt management.  <br>- $431 million foreign exchange gain on euro-denominated debt in 2021 boosted net income, supporting ratio improvements.  <br>- Stockholders' equity expansion significantly reduced debt proportion, enhancing overall financial stability.  <br>- Earnings growth strengthened debt service capacity, with operating income increasing $1.61B year-over-year.  <br>- Combined effects of debt reduction, equity growth, and operational performance positioned NFLX with stronger solvency in 2021.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) increased from 43.8 days in 2020 to 45.1 days in 2021, reflecting extended supplier payment terms potentially tied to the June 2021 Second Amendment Agreement (Exhibit 10.10), enhancing cash flow management.  <br>- Asset Turnover Ratio improved from 0.63 (2020) to 0.67 (2021), driven by investments in content/technology and operational asset optimization, as evidenced by increased property/equipment expenditures in cash flow statements.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) were uncalculable in 2020-2021 due to missing accounts receivable and inventory data, limiting efficiency ratio analysis.  <br>- Higher DPO and improved Asset Turnover suggest strategic focus on cash flow efficiency and asset utilization, aligning with financial health objectives despite data gaps.  <br>- Missing accounts receivable and inventory data restricts comprehensive evaluation of Netflix's cash conversion cycle components (DSO, DIO).
