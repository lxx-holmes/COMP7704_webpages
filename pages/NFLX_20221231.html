          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin declined from 17.2% (2021) to 14.2% (2022) due to 10.6% increase in cost of revenues ($19.2B) and $1.773B foreign currency revenue reduction, despite 6.3% revenue growth.  <br>- Operating profit margin fell from 20.8% to 17.8% as marketing expenses rose 2.3% ($2.5B) and technology/development costs surged 16.6% ($2.7B), with operating income dropping 9.2%.  <br>- ROA decreased from 11.5% to 9.2% due to 12.4% net income decline ($5.1B to $4.5B) and marginally lower asset turnover (66.6% to 65.1%).  <br>- ROE plummeted from 32.3% to 21.6% driven by reduced net income and potential equity base expansion, signaling diminished shareholder returns.  <br>- Gross profit margin contracted from 41.6% to 39.4% as content production/licensing costs outpaced 6.3% revenue growth, with cost of revenues increasing faster than sales.  <br>- Asset turnover slightly declined (66.6% to 65.1%) reflecting less efficient asset utilization amid rising content/operational costs.  <br>- Content costs surged due to upfront cash payments for production, increased amortization expenses (+$1.3B vs 2021), and growing content liabilities (+$1.5B).  <br>- Foreign exchange headwinds impacted 56% of international revenues, weakening non-USD currencies against the dollar.  <br>- Operational inefficiencies emerged from combined 2.3% marketing and 16.6% technology spending increases alongside 9.2% operating income decline.  <br>- Profitability pressures require improved cost controls, operational efficiency measures, and currency risk mitigation strategies.

          - Current ratio improved from 0.95 to 1.17 (2021 vs. 2022) driven by 15% current assets growth ($8,069,825k to $9,266,473k) and 6% current liabilities reduction ($8,488,966k to $7,930,974k).  <br>- Quick ratio mirrored current ratio improvement, rising from 0.95 to 1.17, reflecting enhanced liquidity in more liquid assets.  <br>- Cash ratio increased from 0.71 to 0.76 due to significant growth in cash/short-term investments, including new short-term investments absent in 2021.  <br>- Current assets expansion included $1.2M growth in cash/short-term investments, strengthening cash reserves and liquidity buffers.  <br>- Current liabilities reduction of $558k (6%) improved short-term obligation coverage capacity.  <br>- Content assets management contributed to liquidity via decreased content payments, freeing cash for operational flexibility.

          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio decreased from 1.81 (2021) to 1.34 (2022) due to reduced total liabilities and increased stockholders' equity, reflecting improved debt management and lower reliance on borrowing.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio slightly declined from 8.09 to 7.97, driven by a minor drop in operating income and reduced interest expense, partially linked to content amortization based on viewing patterns.  <br>- Debt-to-Asset Ratio improved from 0.64 to 0.57, indicating better asset utilization with increased content investments (capitalized and amortized over time) reducing debt dependency.  <br>- Content amortization strategy, which aligns expenses with asset usage, supported cash flow management and reduced debt needs.  <br>- Liquidity strengthened through increased cash equivalents and debt repayments, including euro-denominated debt adjustments.  <br>- Strategic focus on original content production increased capitalized assets, enhancing long-term asset efficiency without proportional debt growth.

          - DPO decreased from 17.3 days (2021) to 11.1 days (2022), indicating faster supplier payments that may strain liquidity but reflect improved cash management or stronger supplier relationships.  <br>- CCC analysis is incomplete due to missing Accounts Receivable and Inventory data, preventing DSO and DIO calculations.  <br>- Operating cash flow declined from $2,427M (2020) to $2,026M (2022), linked to rising content costs and amortization expenses.  <br>- Current assets rose 15% to $9,266M (2022), while current liabilities dropped to $7,931M, improving the current ratio to ~1.17 from ~0.95.  <br>- Debt-to-equity ratio improved from ~1.81 (2021) to ~1.33 (2022) as equity grew to $20,777M and liabilities decreased slightly.  <br>- Interest coverage remained stable with interest expense falling to $706M (2022), supporting debt servicing capacity despite lower EBIT.  <br>- Content assets increased to $32,736M (2022), reflecting strategic investments requiring upfront cash outlays that pressure operating cash flow.  <br>- Effective tax rate rose from 12% (2021) to 15% (2022) due to reduced stock-based compensation tax benefits and higher foreign taxes.

        The prediction is based on the analysis of Netflix's financial statements, which show increasing revenues but also rising operating expenses and declining net income. The net profit margin and operating profit margin have decreased, indicating higher costs impacting profitability. Additionally, the return on equity has declined, suggesting less efficient use of equity. These factors, combined with significant interest expenses and debt levels, point towards a potential decrease in earnings per share (EPS) for the next year.
