        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved from 4.09 (2021) to 6.66 (2022) due to cash/cash equivalents growth ($847M ‚Üí $1,990M), marketable securities surge ($10,714M ‚Üí $19,218M), and short-term debt reduction, enhancing short-term liability coverage.  <br>- Quick ratio increased from 3.57 to 5.97, reflecting stronger liquidity excluding inventories, supported by $9,108M operating cash flow (vs. $5,822M in 2021) from higher net income and working capital efficiency.  <br>- Cash ratio rose from 2.95 to 4.89, driven by cash/securities growth ($21,208M in 2022 vs. $11,561M in 2021) and disciplined liquidity management (no share repurchases/commercial paper issuance).  <br>- Operating cash flow growth (+56% YoY) resulted from revenue-driven receivables increases and prepayments for long-term supply agreements, bolstering liquid asset reserves.  <br>- Short-term debt reduction lowered current liabilities, amplifying ratio improvements by decreasing the denominator across all three liquidity metrics.  <br>- Liquidity strategy prioritized retaining cash reserves and avoiding dilution via share buybacks, focusing on financial stability amid market uncertainties.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio decreased from 0.70 (2021) to 0.66 (2022) due to equity growth outpacing debt (retained earnings from improved profitability).  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio rose from 24.63 to 42.56, driven by higher EBIT from increased operating profits, strengthening debt service capacity.  <br>- Financial Leverage ratio (Debt-to-Asset) declined from 41.3% to 39.8% as asset growth (notably cash/marketable securities) exceeded debt increases.  <br>- Long-term Debt to Capitalization ratio increased slightly to 29% (2022) from 26% (2021), reflecting moderate debt growth offset by expanded overall capitalization.  <br>- Improved solvency supported by 42% earnings growth and cash flow expansion, enabling strategic debt management and asset investments without over-leveraging.  <br>- Enhanced capital structure stability achieved through retained earnings accumulation and prudent debt allocation to maintain financial flexibility.  <br>- Maintained manageable long-term debt levels despite increased borrowing, with total debt representing a shrinking proportion of equity/assets.  <br>- Strategic focus on profitability and liquidity (via marketable securities) reduced financial risk while supporting operational growth objectives.

          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) increased slightly from 92 days (2021) to 94 days (2022), indicating a minor decline in cash flow efficiency during revenue growth from $16,675M to $26,914M.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) rose from 53 to 63 days due to slower receivables collection, supported by accounts receivable increasing from $2,429M (2021) to $4,650M (2022).  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) improved from 106 to 100 days despite inventory growth ($1,826M to $2,605M), reflecting more efficient inventory turnover.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) increased from 67 to 69 days, with accounts payable rising from $1,149M to $1,783M, suggesting extended supplier payment terms to retain cash.  <br>- The combined CCC change reflects balancing acts: DSO and DPO increases offset partially by DIO improvement, highlighting working capital management challenges during rapid revenue expansion.

        NVIDIA's strong revenue growth, improving profitability margins, and effective cost management, as evidenced by the financial statements and ratio analysis, suggest that the company is well-positioned for continued growth. The significant increase in net income, coupled with investments in R&D and a solid balance sheet, supports the expectation that earnings per share will increase next year.
