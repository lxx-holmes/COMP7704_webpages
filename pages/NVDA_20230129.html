          - Cost of revenue increased by 8.02% (35.03% to 43.05% of total revenue), contributing to a 7.99% gross profit decline (64.94% to 56.95%) and 12.11% YoY gross profit reduction.  <br>- Operating expenses rose 13.64% (27.63% to 41.27% of revenue), driven by a 7.66% increase in R&D spending (19.56% to 27.22%) and new 5.01% acquisition termination costs.  <br>- Income from operations decreased 21.62% (37.27% to 15.65% of revenue), with net income falling 19.99% (36.18% to 16.18%) and 55.20% YoY, reflecting profitability pressures.  <br>- Marketable securities declined 19.41%, while inventories grew 6.64% and deferred income tax assets increased 5.48%, signaling asset portfolio restructuring.  <br>- Total current assets decreased 9.23%, while total current liabilities rose 6.12% and total liabilities increased 6.54%, indicating a debt structure shift.  <br>- Shareholders' equity fell 6.54% (16.95% YoY), with retained earnings declining 12.05% despite a 5.54% increase in additional paid-in capital.  <br>- Strategic adjustments in asset management and liability handling are evident through inventory buildup, reduced liquidity (marketable securities), and equity erosion.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross margin ratio declined from 64.9% (2022) to 56.9% (2023) due to higher production costs and inventory write-downs for excess/obsolete products.  <br>- Operating margin dropped sharply from 37.29% (2022) to 15.66% (2023) driven by rising R&D/SG&A expenses and a one-time $1.35B acquisition termination cost.  <br>- Net profit margin decreased from 36.21% (2022) to 16.18% (2023) as net income fell by 55% YoY amid higher operating costs.  <br>- ROA declined from 22.08% (2022) to 10.59% (2023) and ROE from 36.65% to 19.76%, reflecting lower net income and reduced asset/equity efficiency despite slightly lower total assets.  <br>- ROIC decreased from 43.68% (2022) to 15.13% (2023) due to lower operating income and changes in invested capital composition.  <br>- Profitability pressures intensified from shifting revenue mix, with lower-margin data center growth partially offsetting declines in historically higher-margin gaming/professional visualization segments.  <br>- Foreign exchange headwinds from a stronger USD increased international pricing pressures, potentially reducing demand.  <br>- All profitability ratios showed material deterioration, indicating systemic challenges in cost control and operational efficiency.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 6.66x (2022) to 3.51x (2023) due to 52% increase in current liabilities ($4,335M to $6,563M) and reduced current assets ($28,829M to $23,073M).  <br>- Quick ratio fell from 6.06x to 2.73x, driven by a 98% inventory surge ($2,605M to $5,159M) tying up liquidity and rising liabilities.  <br>- Cash ratio dropped from 4.89x to 2.03x as cash/marketable securities decreased 37% ($21,208M to $13,296M), influenced by lower operating cash flow and higher tax payments.  <br>- Current liabilities growth included higher accrued liabilities and new short-term debt, amplifying pressure across all liquidity metrics.  <br>- Inventory growth reduced flexibility in meeting obligations without liquidating stock, exacerbating liquidity constraints.  <br>- Despite ratios remaining above 2x, weakened liquidity position necessitates improved cash management, inventory control, and liability monitoring.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-equity ratio increased from 0.66 (2022) to 0.86 (2023) due to higher total liabilities ($17,575M to $19,081M) and reduced shareholders' equity ($26,612M to $22,101M), reflecting greater debt reliance.  <br>- Interest coverage ratio declined sharply from 42.56 (2022) to 16.12 (2023) as EBIT fell from $10,041M to $4,224M while interest expense rose from $236M to $262M.  <br>- Solvency ratio (total liabilities/equity) mirrored debt-to-equity increase, rising from 0.66 to 0.86, signaling higher financial risk from debt expansion.  <br>- $10,953M in net debt reported for 2023 via commercial paper/fixed-rate notes program, with material obligations including $1.02B in unrecognized tax benefits and related penalties.  <br>- Reduced profitability driven by lower operating cash flow (-16% YoY) and higher tax payments, weakening debt service capacity despite maintained solvency.  <br>- Interest rate risk exposure noted from fixed-rate investments/debt portfolio, partially mitigated through structured financing programs.  <br>- Shareholders' equity decline accelerated by $5.2B share repurchases and dividend payments in 2023, compounding leverage effects.

          - DSO improved from 62 days (2022) to 51 days (2023) due to faster accounts receivable collections, enhancing liquidity.  <br>- DIO worsened significantly from 98 days (2022) to 161 days (2023) due to slower inventory turnover, driven by $1.04B inventory reserve expense (vs. $173M in 2022) and supply chain disruptions.  <br>- DPO decreased from 69 days (2022) to 37 days (2023) as NVIDIA paid suppliers quicker, reducing cash reserves and potentially tightening payment terms.  <br>- CCC increased from 91 days (2022) to 175 days (2023) primarily due to DIO deterioration and reduced DPO, outweighing DSO improvement.  <br>- Inventory challenges reflect global risks like economic uncertainty, demand volatility, and supply chain disruptions noted in financial statements.  <br>- Accrued liabilities increased, including excess inventory purchase obligations, further straining cash management efficiency.  <br>- External factors (e.g., currency fluctuations, increased supply chain costs) exacerbated inventory and cash conversion challenges.

        Based on the financial statements, NVIDIA's profitability metrics such as gross profit, operating income, and net income have declined significantly in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in costs, higher operating expenses, and declining margins suggest that the company's profitability is under pressure. Additionally, the decrease in liquidity ratios and increased reliance on debt indicate potential financial strain. While the company is investing in R&D, the current trends point towards a challenging outlook for EPS growth. Therefore, it is predicted that next year's earnings per share will decrease.
