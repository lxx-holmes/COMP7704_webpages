          - Acquisition-related and other expenses decreased by 10.7% as a percentage of total revenue.  <br>- Total revenue grew 17.7% year-over-year, with income from operations up 19.6% and net income rising 26.6%.  <br>- Cash and cash equivalents declined 12.31%, while total current assets fell 13.31%.  <br>- Intangible assets increased 5.99%, goodwill rose 6.20%, and total non-current assets grew 13.31%.  <br>- Total non-current liabilities decreased 5.83%, reflecting improved debt management.  <br>- Accumulated deficit improved 8.14%, with total Oracle stockholders' equity deficit narrowing 6.49% and total stockholders' equity deficit improving 6.44%.  <br>- Total assets increased 23.0% year-over-year, outpacing total liabilities growth of 15.4%.  <br>- Total shareholders' equity surged 126.9%, signaling strengthened financial positioning.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin increased to 17.0% (2023) from 15.8% (2022), driven by 26.8% net income growth outpacing 17.8% revenue expansion and effective cost control.  <br>- Operating profit margin rose to 26.2% (2023) from 25.8% (2022) as operating income grew 19.3%, exceeding revenue growth through improved expense management.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) improved to 6.3% (2023) from 6.1% (2022) despite 22.9% asset growth, reflecting marginally better utilization of expanded resources.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) surged to 546.8% (2023) from negative in 2022, skewed by prior negative equity and amplified by substantial net income growth.  <br>- Cloud/license revenue rose 14% and services revenue jumped 75%, driving higher-margin growth and contributing to overall profitability improvements.  <br>- Expense increases were offset by stronger revenue performance, particularly in cloud/services, preserving margin expansion.  <br>- Acquisition of Cerner Corporation expanded service offerings while maintaining profitability, supporting operational efficiency gains.  <br>- Total asset growth (22.9%) slightly outpaced revenue expansion, indicating moderate but improving asset efficiency trends.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio dropped from 1.62x (2022) to 0.91x (2023), reflecting weakened liquidity as current assets fell below current liabilities.  <br>- Quick ratio declined from 1.43x (2022) to 0.74x (2023), signaling reduced ability to cover short-term liabilities with liquid assets.  <br>- Cash ratio fell from 1.12x (2022) to 0.44x (2023), with cash/marketable securities covering less than half of current liabilities.  <br>- Cash reserves plummeted 54% YoY (2022: $21,383M; 2023: $9,765M) due to $28.2B Cerner acquisition, directly reducing liquidity.  <br>- Current liabilities rose 18% YoY (2022: $19,511M; 2023: $23,090M), driven by higher notes payable, accrued compensation, and deferred revenues.  <br>- Liquidity deterioration stemmed from combined effects of reduced cash reserves (acquisition-driven) and increased short-term obligations.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio rose to 85.3x in 2023 (vs. unmeasurable in 2022 due to negative equity), driven by debt-financed acquisitions (e.g., Cerner Corporation) and $1.3B stock repurchases, with senior notes/commercial paper increasing liabilities.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio declined to 3.73x in 2023 (from 3.96x in 2022) as interest expenses grew faster than EBIT, linked to new debt issuances and partial debt repayments.  <br>- Equity turned positive in 2023 (1.16% Equity Ratio) after Cerner‚Äôs acquisition added $23B+ in intangible assets/goodwill, offsetting prior negative equity from aggressive share buybacks.  <br>- High leverage persists (85.3x Debt-to-Equity) due to strategic reliance on debt for expansion and shareholder returns, with total borrowings detailed in senior notes/commercial paper obligations.  <br>- Improved solvency metrics reflect Cerner‚Äôs integration and equity recovery, but low equity ratio and rising interest costs underscore ongoing financial risk from debt dependency.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO improved slightly from 51.2 days (2022) to 50.5 days (2023), showing better receivables management but still indicating room for improvement.  <br>- DPO declined significantly from 15.2 days (2022) to 11.9 days (2023), reflecting faster supplier payments that may strain cash flow and reduce liquidity.  <br>- CCC increased from 36.0 days (2022) to 38.6 days (2023), driven by the 3.3-day DPO reduction offsetting the 0.7-day DSO improvement, signaling minor cash flow efficiency deterioration.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) remains incalculable due to insufficient inventory/COGS data, limiting full CCC analysis.  <br>- Faster supplier payments (lower DPO) reduced short-term liabilities but weakened Oracle‚Äôs cash position, outweighing receivables progress.  <br>- The 2.6-day CCC increase highlights operational trade-offs, requiring balanced payment terms and enhanced inventory/receivables strategies for liquidity.

        Oracle's financial statements show strong revenue growth, improving net profit margins, and a recovery in net income and EPS from 2022 to 2023. Despite increased reliance on debt and decreased cash reserves, the overall positive trends in profitability and efficiency suggest that EPS will continue to grow next year.
