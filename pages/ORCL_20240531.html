          - No significant changes (exceeding ¬±5%) in revenue line items' percentage of total revenue between 2023 and 2024.  <br>- Gross Profit and Income from Operations both increased 17.26% YoY ($13,093M to $15,353M), exceeding the 10% significance threshold.  <br>- Net Income rose 23.1% YoY ($8,503M to $10,467M), surpassing the 10% threshold.  <br>- Total current liabilities increased 5.19%, while total non-current liabilities decreased 10.27%.  <br>- Oracle Corporation stockholders' equity grew 5.37%, and total stockholders' equity increased 5.39%.  <br>- Total Shareholders' Equity surged 493% YoY, indicating exceptional growth.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin increased from 17.03% (2023) to 19.77% (2024), driven by cloud/license segment revenue growth and higher-margin cloud services improving profitability.  <br>- Operating profit margin rose from 26.21% to 28.97%, reflecting enhanced operational efficiency from strategic adjustments and cloud business expansion.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) improved from 6.33% to 7.42% due to better asset utilization in cloud infrastructure, particularly data centers, despite no segment-specific asset tracking.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) dropped from 546.4% to 113.3% primarily from increased equity levels in 2024, though remains strong; 2023's extreme ROE resulted from unusually low equity.  <br>- Cloud/license segment outperformed with revenue growth outpacing expenses, boosting margins through scalable cloud solutions and license renewals.  <br>- Hardware segment saw slight revenue decline but maintained stable margins via cost management and operational discipline.  <br>- Services segment experienced revenue dip and margin contraction despite controlled expenses, indicating weaker demand or competitive pressures.  <br>- Overall profitability gains reflect Oracle's strategic shift toward cloud-based solutions, offsetting challenges in hardware/services segments.  <br>- Higher 2024 equity levels normalized ROE while improved asset efficiency (ROA) and margins signal stronger operational execution across core businesses.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 0.909 (2023) to 0.715 (2024), and cash ratio fell from 0.423 to 0.331, driven by current liabilities increasing $8,454M (outpacing asset growth).  <br>- Current liabilities surged 37% ($23,090M to $31,544M) primarily from higher notes payable/borrowings.  <br>- Current assets grew $1,550M ($21,004M to $22,554M), insufficient to counter liability expansion.  <br>- Cash/cash equivalents increased modestly ($9,765M to $10,454M), but $3.5B senior note repayments and capital expenditures reduced cash coverage capacity.  <br>- Liquidity deterioration reflects weakened short-term financial flexibility, necessitating closer monitoring of working capital management and debt levels.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio improved from 85.33x (2023) to 14.26x (2024) due to $3.5B debt repayment and equity surge from $1,556M to $9,239M via retained earnings/issuance.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio increased from 3.73x (2023) to 4.37x (2024) as EBIT grew 17% to $15,353M, strengthening interest payment capacity.  <br>- Total liabilities decreased from $132,828M (2023) to $131,737M (2024) through strategic debt management, including terminating/renegotiating term loans.  <br>- Operating cash flow rose 9% in 2024, enabling debt reduction and supporting equity growth without excessive borrowing.  <br>- Improved leverage reflects reduced long-term risk, with equity now representing 6.5% of total capital (up from 1.2% in 2023).  <br>- Debt restructuring efforts optimized Oracle's capital structure, replacing high-interest obligations with more favorable terms.

          - DSO increased from 50.5 to 54.2 days (2023 to 2024), reflecting slower receivables collection due to economic conditions/customer challenges, supported by credit loss allowances tied to geographic/economic factors.  <br>- DPO rose sharply from 32.4 to 56.8 days, indicating strategic supplier payment delays to conserve cash, enabled by liquidity from diversified cash holdings but risking supplier strain.  <br>- CCC shifted from +18.1 to -2.6 days, driven by DSO/DPO changes and potential inventory data gaps, signaling cash flow pressure from paying suppliers faster than customer collections.  <br>- Despite negative CCC, Oracle‚Äôs cash equivalents grew with 9% operating cash flow growth in 2024, supported by operational inflows offsetting capital expenditures/debt repayments.  <br>- DSO and DPO increases (3.7 and 24.4 days, respectively) contributed to a 20.7-day CCC decline, highlighting evolving cash management dynamics requiring monitoring for sustainability.  <br>- Notes clarify CCC analysis is limited by missing DIO data but emphasize operational cash strength despite receivables/payables challenges.
