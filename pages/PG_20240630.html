          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin decreased slightly from 17.9% (2023) to 17.7% (2024), likely due to higher taxes/expenses and financial estimate adjustments per Notes to Financial Statements.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin remained stable at 22.1% both years, reflecting consistent cost control and unchanged revenue recognition policies.  <br>- ROA stayed at 12.2%, indicating efficient asset utilization supported by straight-line depreciation methods and no major changes in asset management.  <br>- ROE declined from 31.1% (2023) to 29.5% (2024), attributed to reduced net income or increased equity from share repurchases/dividends, though returns remain strong.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin improved significantly from 48.0% (2023) to 51.4% (2024), driven by better cost management in materials, labor, and supply chain efficiency.  <br>- Overall profitability remained robust with gross margin gains and stable operational efficiency, despite minor impacts from tax/equity adjustments.  <br>- Slight ratio declines in Net Profit Margin/ROE were offset by consistent operational performance and asset productivity.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved from 0.634 (2023) to 0.735 (2024), driven by a $2.129B reduction in current liabilities ($35.756B to $33.627B) and better asset management.  <br>- Quick ratio increased from 0.384 to 0.464, reflecting enhanced liquidity from $1.236B cash reserve growth ($8.246B to $9.482B) and 18% operating cash flow improvement.  <br>- Cash ratio rose from 0.231 to 0.282 due to expanded cash holdings, though still indicates reliance on non-cash assets for 71.8% of short-term obligations.  <br>- All ratios remain below 1, requiring inventory liquidation or asset conversion to fully cover $33.627B current liabilities despite working capital efficiency gains.  <br>- Operational improvements included optimized trade payables, reduced inventory levels, and strategic cash deployment, freeing resources for debt coverage.  <br>- Sustained liquidity challenges persist, with cash covering only 28.2% of liabilities, necessitating ongoing focus on cash flow management and inventory turnover.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio improved from 0.518 (2023) to 0.5 (2024) due to a $3.5B increase in shareholders‚Äô equity (from $47,065M to $50,559M) and effective debt management.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio declined from 24.25 (2023) to 20.3 (2024), potentially reflecting higher interest expenses or slower EBIT growth despite a 2% net earnings increase and 18% operating cash flow surge.  <br>- Debt-to-Asset ratio improved from 0.610 (2023) to 0.587 (2024) as total assets grew by $1.5B, indicating stronger asset base management relative to liabilities.  <br>- A $1.3B impairment charge on the Gillette brand reduced equity but was mitigated by proactive debt strategies, preserving solvency ratio improvements.  <br>- Operating cash flow increased 18%, bolstering debt repayment capacity and supporting overall ratio enhancements despite the interest coverage dip.  <br>- Solvency remains robust, with reduced financial risk from lower debt reliance and sustained ability to meet obligations.

          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved by 7.6 days (2024: -47.6 days vs. 2023: -40.0 days), driven by a 12.5-day increase in Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) due to extended supplier payment terms and effective credit market management.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increased by 2.3 days (2024: 26.6 days vs. 2023: 24.3 days), reflecting slower customer collections from economic hardships and geopolitical tensions impacting trade.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) rose by 2.5 days (2024: 62.9 days vs. 2023: 60.4 days) due to inventory buildup from Russia-Ukraine war-related supply chain disruptions and strategic maintenance of key manufacturing arrangements.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) increased to 137.1 days in 2024 (vs. 124.6 days in 2023), showing improved supplier negotiation strength and liquidity management, offsetting higher DSO/DIO pressures.  <br>- Despite DSO and DIO challenges, CCC improvement highlights robust working capital efficiency, balancing economic uncertainties and supply chain risks through extended payables and financial strategy adjustments.  <br>- Geopolitical conflicts and trade controls exacerbated collection delays and inventory turnover, while proactive supplier agreements and liquidity focus mitigated cash flow risks.

        Procter & Gamble has shown consistent growth in net sales, decreasing costs, and improving margins. The company's strong cash position, efficient working capital management, and stable profitability ratios indicate a positive outlook.
