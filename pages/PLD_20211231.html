        Risks:  <br>- COVID-19 may disrupt customer leasing, delay development, reduce investment recovery, increase construction costs, and strain workforce availability.  <br>- Cybersecurity threats and system failures could cause operational disruptions, financial losses, and reputational damage.  <br>- Dependence on key personnel poses risks if retention challenges arise or compensation costs escalate.  <br>- Internal control deficiencies may lead to financial misstatements, restatements, or declining investor confidence.  <br>- Climate change risks include property damage from extreme weather and stricter regulatory compliance costs.  <br><br>Opportunities:  <br>- E-commerce growth drives sustained demand for logistics facilities supporting retail and online fulfillment.  <br>- Geographic diversification across U.S., Europe, and Asia reduces exposure to regional market volatility.  <br>- Co-investment ventures expand portfolio scale and partnerships, enhancing capital recycling and returns.  <br>- Development pipeline (458M sq ft in O&M portfolio) supports long-term growth and occupancy potential.  <br>- Hedging strategies and fixed-rate debt mitigate foreign exchange and interest rate volatility impacts.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin increased from 33.2% (2020) to 61.6% (2021) due to 7% revenue growth outpacing 3% expense growth and improved cost control.  <br>- Operating profit margin rose from 47.5% to 67.3%, driven by 51% operating income growth from property development gains and dispositions.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) doubled from 2.6% to 5.0% through better utilization of existing assets and strategic property dispositions.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) increased from 4.1% to 7.8% as net earnings to common stockholders more than doubled (+99%).  <br>- Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) improved from 4.3% to 6.5% due to refinancing activities lowering borrowing costs and extended debt maturities.  <br>- Total expenses grew only 3% while revenues increased 7%, reflecting disciplined cost management and operational efficiency.  <br>- Gains from property dispositions and development activities contributed significantly to operating income growth.  <br>- Auditor reports highlighted efficient asset holding period assessments, supporting improved asset utilization metrics.  <br>- Management refinancing strategies reduced interest costs and optimized capital structure, enhancing profitability ratios.  <br>- Notes to financial statements confirm gains from dispositions and lower financing costs as key drivers of ratio improvements.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved slightly from 0.179 (2020) to 0.186 (2021) due to increased current assets relative to liabilities, though liabilities still exceed assets.  <br>- Quick ratio mirrored current ratio trends at 0.179 (2020) and 0.186 (2021), showing minimal liquidity improvement without inventory reliance.  <br>- Cash ratio remained critically low at 0.030 (2020) to 0.032 (2021) as cash reserves dipped from $598,086 to $556,117, indicating heavy reliance on non-cash assets.  <br>- Current liabilities increased from $19.7M (2020) to $20.7M (2021), outpacing asset growth and pressuring liquidity ratios.  <br>- Stability in cash reserves (3.0%-3.2% cash ratio) failed to offset liquidity risks from rising liabilities and illiquid asset dependence.  <br>- Management must prioritize reducing short-term debt and boosting cash reserves to mitigate ongoing liquidity challenges.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio increased slightly from 0.46x (2020) to 0.47x (2021) due to modest debt growth, offset by 3.8% equity growth maintaining conservative leverage and disciplined debt management.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio surged from 5.97x to 13.13x, driven by stronger earnings and refinancing that reduced the weighted average effective interest rate from 2.2% to 1.7%.  <br>- Solvency Ratio (Total Liabilities/Equity) improved from 0.54x to 0.55x as equity growth outpaced liability increases, enhancing long-term obligation management capacity.  <br>- Equity expanded 3.8% in 2021, stabilizing solvency and reducing debt reliance despite slight liability growth.  <br>- Refinancing activities lowered interest expenses by redeeming high-interest senior notes, contributing to improved profitability and reduced financial risk.  <br>- Overall solvency improvements reflect stronger earnings, controlled debt levels, and strategic refinancing to optimize capital structure.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO), and Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) were not calculable for 2020-2021 due to missing Accounts Receivable, Inventory, and COGS data.  <br>- Accounts Payable increased 9.5% (2020-2021), suggesting strategic extension of supplier payment terms to conserve cash for investments.  <br>- Cash and Cash Equivalents decreased 7% (2020-2021), driven by $2.6B in real estate development/acquisition outflows to expand logistics assets for e-commerce demand.  <br>- Total Assets grew 4.3% (2020-2021) from portfolio expansion, aligning with $2.996B operating cash flow (+2020) showing operational efficiency despite capital expenditures.  <br>- Net effective lease mark-to-market of 36% indicates rent growth potential upon renewals, supporting future Net Operating Income (NOI) increases.  <br>- Strategic Capital segment (10-15% of recurring revenues) grew through partnerships, diversifying revenue streams and mitigating risk exposure.  <br>- Insufficient CCC calculation data limits cash flow efficiency analysis, but increased payables and decreased cash suggest active liquidity management for growth initiatives.
