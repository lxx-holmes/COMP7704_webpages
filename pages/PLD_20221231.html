          - Strategic Capital Revenue increased 5.0%, while Gains on Development Properties fell 7.1% and Gains on Other Dispositions declined 6.33%.  <br>- Operating Income decreased 9.3%, with Losses on Early Extinguishment of Debt reducing 3.6%. Earnings Before Income Taxes fell 8.0%.  <br>- Consolidated Net Earnings declined 6.5%, with Net Earnings to Controlling Interests and Common Stockholders both down 5.4%.  <br>- Total Revenue grew 25.5% year-over-year, Gross Profit rose 41.0%, and Net Income increased 14.5%.  <br>- Net investments in real estate properties grew from 77.8% to 82.6% of total assets, while investments in unconsolidated entities fell from 14.7% to 11.1%.  <br>- Assets held for sale/contribution decreased from 1.1% to 0.6% of total assets; Cash reserves dropped sharply from 0.95% to 0.32%.  <br>- Other liabilities increased from 3.03% to 5.04% of total liabilities/equity.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin declined from 61.6% (2021) to 56.2% (2022) due to increased expenses from Duke Realty's $23.2B acquisition and integration costs.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) dropped from 5.0% to 3.8%, reflecting reduced efficiency as newly acquired 144M sq ft portfolio required time to optimize profitability.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) decreased from 7.7% to 5.8% due to equity dilution from acquisition financing and lower net income.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin fell sharply from 67.4% to 58.0% from higher operating expenses, including maintenance and leasing costs for newly integrated properties.  <br>- Duke Realty acquisition expanded assets but included non-strategic properties marked for sale, temporarily lowering asset productivity.  <br>- Equity dilution occurred as Prologis issued new shares to fund the acquisition, increasing the equity base without immediate profit growth.  <br>- Auditors flagged critical challenges in assessing property holding periods, with potential impairments affecting profitability if holding periods shortened.  <br>- Integration complexities and operational scaling efforts contributed to reduced cost control across all profitability metrics.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 0.186 (2021) to 0.169 (2022), with quick ratios mirroring this trend, indicating insufficient liquid assets to cover short-term liabilities.  <br>- Cash ratio dropped from 0.027 (2021) to 0.009 (2022) due to cash reserves halving from $556,117K to $278,483K, severely limiting immediate liquidity.  <br>- Total debt surged by $6.16B (to $23.88B in 2022) primarily from the $23.2B Duke Realty acquisition, increasing liabilities and pressuring liquidity ratios.  <br>- As a REIT, Prologis holds illiquid long-term real estate assets, relying on operational cash flow ($2.5B+ operating income) rather than liquid reserves to meet obligations.  <br>- Year-over-year liquidity decline reflects strategic debt-fueled expansion but is partially offset by strong operational cash generation typical of REIT business models.  <br>- Low ratios (current, quick, cash) highlight reliance on consistent cash flow from operations to service short-term debts, necessitating close monitoring of financial flexibility.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio decreased from 0.55 (2021) to 0.52 (2022) due to 53% equity growth ($20.12M increase) outpacing 45% liability growth ($9.29M increase), driven by equity issuance for Duke Realty acquisition.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio slightly declined from 13.48 (2021) to 12.95 (2022) as interest expenses rose 16% ($309K in 2022 vs. $266K in 2021), partially offset by 11% EBIT growth to $4.0M from acquisition-driven rental income.  <br>- Total liabilities grew $30.0M in 2022 vs. $20.7M in 2021, while equity expanded to $57.9M (2022) from $37.7M (2021), reflecting $23.2B Duke Realty acquisition financed through combined debt/equity.  <br>- Solvency ratios remained healthy with moderate leverage (0.52-0.55 Debt-to-Equity) and strong interest coverage (>12x), despite increased debt levels post-acquisition.  <br>- Equity growth included new share issuance for acquisition financing, mitigating leverage impact while expanding property portfolio and EBIT.  <br>- Operational performance improved through higher rental income from acquired Duke Realty assets, supporting earnings despite rising interest costs.  <br>- The company maintained balanced growth strategy with conservative debt use and robust capacity to service obligations.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO improved from 15 days (2021) to 14 days (2022), reflecting faster collections and enhanced cash flow due to strong internal controls and active portfolio management.  <br>- DIH remained at 0 days (2021 and 2022), indicating no inventory held and minimal inventory management needs.  <br>- DPO increased from 31 days (2021) to 34 days (2022), extending payment terms to suppliers for greater flexibility.  <br>- CCC improved from -16 days (2021) to -20 days (2022), showing more efficient cash management as collections outpaced payables, supported by operational efficiency and management focus on cash flow.  <br>- DSO and DPO calculations assumed minimal accounts receivable and used Total Expenses as a proxy for COGS due to data limitations.  <br>- Negative CCC underscores the company‚Äôs liquidity strength, with cash cycle efficiency driven by faster collections, extended supplier terms, and consistent inventory practices.  <br>- Internal controls and active management (e.g., rent increases, occupancy maintenance) directly contributed to improved efficiency ratios and cash flow optimization.

        Despite revenue growth and an increase in net earnings, Prologis, Inc. faces declining profitability ratios, including net profit margin, ROA, ROE, and operating profit margin. Additionally, liquidity ratios have decreased, indicating fewer liquid assets to cover short-term liabilities. While the company maintains a healthy solvency position and efficient cash management, the margin compression and increased expenses may negatively impact future earnings, leading to a potential decrease in EPS next year.
