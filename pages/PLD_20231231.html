          - Income from Operations decreased from 58.0% to 46.2% of total revenue (-11.8% change) between 2022 and 2023.  <br>- Other Income/Expenses shifted from 3.7% to -3.0% of total revenue (-6.7% change), reflecting increased expenses or reduced non-operational income.  <br>- Net Income declined from 56.2% to 38.1% of total revenue (-18.1% change), indicating reduced profitability despite revenue growth.  <br>- Total Revenue grew 34.4% from $5,973,692 (2022) to $8,023,469 (2023), with Gross Profit rising 35.1% to $3,084,483.  <br>- Debt increased from 27.1% to 31.1% of total liabilities/equity (+3.9%), while Other liabilities decreased slightly (-0.2% to 4.8%).  <br>- Total Assets grew 5.8% year-over-year, accompanied by a 17.2% increase in Total Liabilities.  <br>- Total Equity remained stable with a marginal 0.07% decrease, signaling retained earnings offsetting liability growth.

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin declined from 56% (2022) to 38% (2023) due to higher expenses, adverse currency fluctuations, and potential impairment considerations from extended property holding periods.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin decreased from 58% to 46%, reflecting operational inefficiencies from international operations management and supply chain disruptions.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) slightly declined from 3.8% to 3.3%, indicating less efficient asset utilization amid economic instability and regulatory changes.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) decreased from 5.8% to 5.3%, suggesting reduced equity efficiency influenced by broader profitability challenges.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin improved marginally from 38.2% to 38.5%, showing better direct cost control despite overall margin pressures.  <br>- Currency volatility and hedging ineffectiveness (despite using derivatives and borrowing strategies) contributed to profitability erosion.  <br>- Economic downturns and regulatory shifts reduced pricing power while increasing compliance costs.  <br>- Risk factors including supply chain disruptions and foreign exchange impacts were explicitly cited in financial disclosures.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved from 2.92 (2022) to 2.64 (2023) due to total assets growing faster ($87.9M‚Üí$93.0M) than liabilities ($30.0M‚Üí$35.2M), driven by $3.1B acquisitions and operational performance.  <br>- Quick ratio remained stable at 0.16 (both years) despite cash increasing from $278,483 to $530,388, offset by slight other assets decline ($4.8M‚Üí$4.7M), reflecting continued reliance on non-liquid assets.  <br>- Cash ratio rose from 0.009 (2022) to 0.015 (2023) with higher cash reserves but remains critically low, indicating persistent challenges meeting obligations with cash alone.  <br>- $2.1B generated from asset sales/contributions balanced acquisition spending, while amended credit facilities increased liabilities, impacting liquidity ratios.  <br>- High occupancy rates (97.8%) and rent growth boosted asset valuations, with strategic capital allocation and rental revenue supporting asset quality.  <br>- Analysis uses total assets/liabilities (non-standard method) instead of current assets/liabilities, potentially overstating liquidity due to inclusion of long-term items.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio rose from 51.9% (2022) to 60.8% (2023) due to increased total debt (from $23.9B to $29.0B) and slightly lower equity, reflecting higher financial leverage for expansion.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio dropped from 11.94x to 5.4x as interest expenses grew faster than operating income, signaling reduced capacity to meet obligations amid rising debt/interest rates.  <br>- Solvency Ratio (Total Liabilities/Equity) increased from 51.9% to 60.8%, driven by higher liabilities and lower equity, indicating elevated financial risk.  <br>- Expanded debt burden and rising expenses strained financial stability, with revenue growth offset by weakened interest coverage and reliance on debt financing.  <br>- Deterioration in ratios underscores the need for cautious debt management to balance growth ambitions with long-term solvency.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Prologis reduced Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) from 169.1 days (2022) to 130.6 days (2023), indicating faster supplier payments due to improved cash flow management and operational efficiency.  <br>- Enhanced liquidity ($6.0 billion total available, including $5.5 billion credit capacity and $530 million cash) enabled quicker payments to suppliers.  <br>- Operational efficiency drove strong cash flow, supported by 97.6% occupancy rates, effective expense control, and active portfolio management.  <br>- $2.1 billion in net proceeds from asset sales/contributions and venture formations boosted cash reserves, facilitating prompt supplier payments.  <br>- Credit facility amendments (2023 Global Facility, Japanese yen revolver) increased financial flexibility, extending maturities and supporting efficient payable practices.  <br>- Missing accounts receivable and inventory data prevented full Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) analysis, limiting assessment of Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO).

        Despite revenue growth, factors such as increased expenses, higher interest costs, declining profitability margins, and higher debt levels are expected to negatively impact earnings per share. The dip in net earnings and reduced efficiency in asset utilization also contribute to this outlook.
