        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross profit margin improved from 77.9% (2021) to 78.6% (2022) due to better cost management as revenue grew from $1.54B to $1.91B.  <br>- Operating profit margin rose from -26.67% to -8.47% through improved operational efficiency and expense control, reducing operating losses.  <br>- Net profit margin increased from -33.75% to -19.62% via enhanced revenue conversion efficiency and potential non-operating expense reductions.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) improved from -16.02% to -10.72% due to better asset utilization driven by revenue growth and reduced losses.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) increased from -22.72% to -14.15%, reflecting more effective use of equity despite ongoing unprofitability.  <br>- Revenue grew from $1.54B (2021) to $1.91B (2022), indicating scalable operations and contributing to margin improvements.  <br>- Net loss decreased from $520.38M to $373.71M, demonstrating progress in cost management and operational efficiency.  <br>- All metrics show consistent improvement, but profitability remains elusive, requiring further cost control and revenue expansion.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio improved from 4.34 (2021) to 5.17 (2022) due to current assets increasing from $2,863.25M to $3,041.58M (including cash equivalents rising $307.87M and accounts receivable up $67.42M) paired with current liabilities decreasing from $660.06M to $587.94M.  <br>- Cash ratio increased from 3.47 to 4.42 as cash/cash equivalents grew to $2,598.54M (2022) while current liabilities declined, reflecting stronger liquidity without debt obligations under its amended 2014 Credit Facility.  <br>- Quick ratio calculation remains limited due to undisclosed inventory data.  <br>- Reduced current liabilities driven by lower customer deposits ($161.61M to $141.99M) and deferred revenue, enhancing short-term financial stability despite ongoing net losses.  <br>- Cash reserves expanded through effective working capital management, maintaining $2.59B in cash equivalents despite operational losses.  <br>- No outstanding debt strengthens balance sheet, with amended credit facility increasing borrowing capacity without immediate utilization.  <br>- Accounts receivable growth ($190.92M to $258.35M) indicates increased billings but requires monitoring for collection efficiency.  <br>- Improved ratios demonstrate enhanced capacity to cover short-term obligations, supported by asset growth (+6.2%) and liability reduction (-10.9%) year-over-year.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio improved from 0.42 (2021) to 0.31 (2022) due to reduced debt reliance, equity growth via common stock issuance, preferred stock conversion, and equity-based compensation (e.g., stock options, RSUs).  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio declined from 135.2 (2021) to 89.9 (2022), likely from higher interest costs or lower EBIT, but remained robust with no outstanding debt under the amended 2014 Credit Facility.  <br>- Equity Ratio increased from 0.70 (2021) to 0.76 (2022) driven by equity financing via stock issuances, including direct listing benefits and reduced debt dependence.  <br>- Solvency Ratio improved from 0.42 (2021) to 0.31 (2022), reflecting stronger equity coverage of liabilities aligned with debt reduction and equity growth strategies.  <br>- Operational strength supported high EBIT, enabling strong interest coverage despite the decline, with financial stability reinforced by equity-focused financing.  <br>- Strategic shifts included amending credit facilities for unused borrowing capacity and prioritizing equity instruments (e.g., RSUs, stock options) to enhance balance sheet resilience.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO increased from ~45 days (2021) to ~49 days (2022), reflecting slower customer collections potentially due to extended payment terms or customer financial difficulties, as indicated by a higher allowance for credit losses ($10.1 million in 2022).  <br>- DPO decreased sharply from ~80.5 days (2021) to ~40 days (2022), driven by faster supplier payments enabled by improved cash management and access to a $950 million credit facility in 2022.  <br>- The DSO increase may signal challenges in receivables management or strategic customer retention efforts, while the DPO decline reflects prioritization of supplier relationships and liquidity optimization.  <br>- Without Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO), full CCC calculation is incomplete, but rising DSO and falling DPO suggest a likely CCC increase, indicating potential cash flow strain.  <br>- Strategic factors include alignment with cash flow efficiency goals, balancing customer payment term extensions with timely supplier payments, and leveraging credit facilities to support operational liquidity.
