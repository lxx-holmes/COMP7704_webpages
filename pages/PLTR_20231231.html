          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio decreased from 0.31 (2022) to 0.27 (2023) due to reduced total liabilities ($818,802 to $746,018) and increased equity from transitioning to net income.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio improved from negative (2022) to 34.6 (2023) as net income shifted from a $371,094 loss to a $217,375 profit, enabling interest expense coverage.  <br>- Solvency Ratio improved from 0.31 (2022) to 0.27 (2023) driven by lower liabilities and increased cash/marketable securities ($2,598,540 to $3,674,179), enhancing liquidity and stability.  <br>- Net income transition from loss to profit in 2023 strengthened equity, reduced debt reliance, and improved all solvency metrics.  <br>- Cash and marketable securities growth by $1.08 million (2022‚Äì2023) reduced financing dependence and supported debt reduction efforts.  <br>- Total liabilities decreased by $72,784 (2022‚Äì2023), directly lowering debt burden and improving Debt-to-Equity and Solvency Ratios.  <br>- Profitability shift, liability management, and liquidity gains collectively strengthened Palantir's financial stability and long-term solvency.

          - DSO increased from 49.5 days (2022) to 59.89 days (2023) due to slower receivables collection, extended customer payment terms, and a higher allowance for credit losses reflecting collectability concerns.  <br>- DPO decreased sharply from 40 days (2022) to 10.25 days (2023) as Palantir paid suppliers faster, likely to improve supplier relationships or leverage stronger cash flow from operating activities.  <br>- Revenue grew from $1.9B (2022) to $2.2B (2023), but cash flow was strained by $106M increase in accounts receivable (vs. $72M in 2022), tying up liquidity.  <br>- Accounts payable decreased by $31M (2023), indicating shorter payment terms with suppliers despite potential cash retention trade-offs.  <br>- Missing inventory data prevents Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) calculation, limiting full Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) analysis.  <br>- Combined DSO/DPO shifts highlight working capital management challenges, requiring improved receivables processes and strategic balance in payable terms.
