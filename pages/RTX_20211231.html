        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin improved to 6% (2021) vs -6.2% (2020) due to pandemic recovery, absence of 2020's $3.2B goodwill impairment and $334M unfavorable EAC adjustments, and Raytheon merger synergies.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin rose to 7.7% from -3.3%, supported by operational efficiency and improved EAC adjustments (favorable up 29% to $1,286M, unfavorable down 28% to $1,176M).  <br>- ROA turned positive at 2.4% (2021) vs -2.17% (2020), reflecting better asset utilization post-COVID and reduced financial impairments.  <br>- ROE reached 5.28% vs -4.88%, driven by restored profitability, cost controls, and merger integration benefits.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin increased to 19.4% from 15.1% through strategic pricing and cost management post-Raytheon merger.  <br>- Defense bookings surged 29% to $40B (2021), offsetting pandemic-driven commercial aerospace declines (Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney segments).  <br>- Raytheon merger completion (April 2020) reset contract accounting, enabling operational efficiency gains and profitability normalization by 2021.  <br>- Commercial aerospace recovery reduced 2021 supply chain disruptions and credit losses compared to 2020's pandemic lows.

      <section class="horizontal-section" id="liquidity-analysis">
        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 1.21 (2020) to 1.18 (2021) due to reduced current assets from debt repayment/share repurchases and increased liabilities, exacerbated by COVID-19's impact on commercial aerospace revenues.  <br>- Quick ratio decreased from 0.95 to 0.93, reflecting slower conversion of receivables/contract assets into cash and inventory buildup despite preparation for unrealized pandemic-related demand.  <br>- Cash ratio dropped from 0.24 to 0.22 as cash reserves were depleted by $2.3B in financing activities (debt repayment, share buybacks) and reduced cash flows from COVID-affected Collins Aerospace/Pratt & Whitney segments.  <br>- Liquidity erosion occurred despite current ratio remaining above 1, with quick ratio below 1 indicating reliance on non-liquid assets; cash ratio highlights constrained cash coverage of liabilities.  <br>- Accounts receivable and contract assets increased 12% YoY, tying up liquidity amid credit loss risks noted in financial statements.  <br>- Inventory levels rose 8% due to pandemic-driven demand miscalculations in commercial aerospace, slowing turnover and reducing asset liquidity.  <br>- COVID-19 reduced commercial aerospace revenue by 19% in 2021, with asset impairments and operational constraints directly impacting working capital efficiency.  <br>- $1.8B in share repurchases and $3.2B debt repayments (per cash flow statements) prioritized capital returns over liquidity preservation during market uncertainty.  <br>- All liquidity metrics show minor but consistent declines, signaling need for improved receivables management and inventory optimization to offset pandemic-related cash flow volatility.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio improved from 1.223 (2020) to 1.186 (2021) due to $4.254 billion long-term debt repayment, lower-interest debt issuance (e.g., 1.900% notes), and equity recovery from $3.2 billion goodwill impairment absence in 2021.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio surged from 1.38x (2020) to 3.75x (2021) driven by $4.145 billion net income recovery (vs. $2.928B loss in 2020), debt refinancing reducing interest expenses, and $7.142B operational cash flow in 2021.  <br>- Financial Leverage ratio decreased slightly from 2.25 (2020) to 2.21 (2021) as stable total assets combined with higher equity from profitability and debt reduction offset pandemic-related impacts.  <br>- Operational cash flow increased to $7.142 billion in 2021 (vs. $4.334B in 2020), enabling debt repayment and reducing contract liabilities, while refinancing lowered borrowing costs (e.g., 2.375% notes due 2032).  <br>- Absence of 2020's $3.2 billion goodwill impairment charge strengthened equity in 2021, contrasting with 2020's solvency metric pressures from pandemic-driven asset write-downs.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO improved from 58 days (2020) to 52 days (2021) due to faster receivables collection, supported by factoring agreements reducing cash flow impact from $1.3B to $0.2B.  <br>- DIO decreased from 71 days (2020) to 65 days (2021) through optimized inventory management using sales forecasts and historical usage rates to reduce excess stock.  <br>- DPO slightly declined from 54 days (2020) to 53 days (2021), reflecting marginally faster supplier payments without explicit term changes, linked to broader working capital optimization.  <br>- CCC improved by 11 days (75 days in 2020 to 64 days in 2021), driven primarily by DSO and DIO efficiencies rather than payables extension.  <br>- Factoring agreements accelerated cash inflows for receivables, while inventory reductions lowered carrying costs and improved liquidity.  <br>- COVID-19 impacts on commercial aerospace operations intensified focus on cash flow management, influencing inventory and receivables strategies.  <br>- No evidence of strained supplier relationships despite DPO reduction, as payment term changes were minimal and aligned with working capital goals.  <br>- $0.2B factoring impact in 2021 vs. $1.3B in 2020 indicates reduced reliance on receivables financing while maintaining collection efficiency.
