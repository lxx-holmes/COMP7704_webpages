        <!-- Your text goes here. -->
        **Risks:**  <br>- Global economic volatility, supply chain disruptions, and inflation may increase costs and delay production, particularly impacting fixed-price government contracts.  <br>- Dependence on U.S. government defense spending exposes revenue to budget shifts, political priorities, and potential program cancellations.  <br>- Supply chain vulnerabilities, including single-source suppliers, geopolitical tensions, and material shortages, risk production delays and cost overruns.  <br>- Cybersecurity threats and data breaches could disrupt operations, compromise sensitive information, and result in financial or reputational damage.  <br>- Regulatory compliance risks (export controls, environmental laws, anti-corruption) may lead to penalties, operational delays, or loss of government contracts.  <br><br>**Opportunities:**  <br>- Digital transformation initiatives aim to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and meet evolving government contract requirements for advanced engineering.  <br>- Growing demand for sustainable aviation technologies (low-carbon products, alternative energy) aligns with customer and regulatory climate goals.  <br>- Restructuring efforts (facility optimization, workforce adjustments) target long-term cost savings and improved manufacturing competitiveness.  <br>- Recovery in commercial air travel boosts aftermarket services and spare parts demand for engines and aerospace systems.  <br>- Geopolitical tensions and increased defense budgets drive demand for missile systems, sensors, and advanced defense technologies.

          - No significant changes (>¬±5%) in percentage of total revenue across line items between 2021 and 2022.  <br>- Net income grew 34.4% year-over-year (2021 to 2022), indicating strong profitability.  <br>- Cash/cash equivalents decreased from 4.8% to 3.9% of Total Assets (significant change).  <br>- Intangible assets declined from 23.8% to 23.1% of Total Assets (significant change).  <br>- Future pension/postretirement obligations dropped from 9.1% to 5.7% of Total Liabilities & Equity (significant change).  <br>- Short-term borrowings rose from 0.08% to 0.39% of Total Liabilities & Equity (significant change).  <br>- Total current liabilities increased from 21.9% to 24.6% of Total Liabilities & Equity (significant change).  <br>- Treasury stock grew from 7.9% to 8.6% of Total Equity (significant change).  <br>- Total Assets (-1.6%), Total Liabilities (-2.2%), and Total Shareholders' Equity (-0.6%) showed no material year-over-year changes (<10% threshold).

        <h3>Profitability Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin increased from 6.00% (2021) to 7.75% (2022), driven by $1,333M net income growth from higher sales and improved margins, supported by long-term contract revenue recognition in Critical Audit Matters.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin improved slightly (7.70% to 8.07%) due to enhanced cost management, particularly through contract cost judgments highlighted in audit documentation.  <br>- Return on Assets rose from 2.39% to 3.27%, reflecting better asset utilization efficiency linked to management's impairment assessment controls and financial reporting accuracy.  <br>- Return on Equity increased from 5.17% to 7.00%, showing stronger shareholder returns via higher net earnings without proportional equity growth, as noted in Significant Changes analysis.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin declined from 24.5% to 20.4%, attributed to rising production costs, inflationary pressures, and pricing challenges impacting revenue/cost completion estimates in audits.  <br>- Net income growth of $1,333M highlights operational success but contrasts with gross margin contraction, signaling ongoing cost control challenges amid sales expansion.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio declined from 1.186 (2021) to 1.085 (2022) due to current liabilities rising 10.5% ($35.4B‚Üí$39.1B) outpacing current assets' 0.9% growth.  <br>- Quick ratio dropped from 0.927 to 0.813 as cash reserves fell 20.6% ($7.8B‚Üí$6.2B) and inventory grew 15.6% ($9.2B‚Üí$10.6B), reducing liquid assets coverage.  <br>- Cash ratio decreased sharply from 0.221 to 0.159, reflecting reduced cash availability relative to obligations despite maintaining minimal coverage capacity.  <br>- Higher accounts payable and contract liabilities drove the current liabilities increase, straining short-term liquidity without proportional asset growth.  <br>- Inventory surge to $10.6B suggests potential working capital inefficiencies, as stockpiling ties up resources while liabilities escalate.  <br>- Liquidity remains technically stable (current ratio >1) but requires improved cash flow management to avoid reliance on non-cash assets.  <br>- Management priority should address cash conservation and inventory turnover to mitigate tightening liquidity constraints.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity Ratio decreased from 1.186 (2021) to 1.165 (2022) as total liabilities declined from $86,705M to $84,650M, reflecting reduced leverage and improved solvency.  <br>- The ratio improvement was supported by $1.5B debt repayment via tender offer and new notes issuance in 2021, contributing to lower debt levels.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio increased from 3.75 to 4.24 as operating profit rose 9% ($4,958M to $5,414M) while interest expense decreased slightly ($1,322M to $1,276M).  <br>- Stronger interest coverage reflects improved operational efficiency and earnings growth, enhancing debt servicing capability.  <br>- Despite lower leverage, Debt-to-Equity remains above 1, indicating continued reliance on debt financing and associated risks.  <br>- Strategic debt management (repayments, refinancing) and operating profit growth in 2022 collectively strengthened financial stability.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - DSO improved from 54.8 days (2021) to 49.5 days (2022) due to faster customer collections, credit risk management, and optimized receivables processes despite higher 2020 credit losses.  <br>- DIO increased from 64.5 to 72.3 days, reflecting slower inventory turnover from supply chain disruptions, reduced demand, and inventory reserves/impairments in Collins and Pratt & Whitney businesses.  <br>- DPO rose from 61.5 to 67.7 days as RTX extended supplier payment terms strategically to retain cash amid economic uncertainties, enhancing liquidity.  <br>- Overall CCC decreased from 57.8 to 54.1 days, driven by DSO and DPO improvements offsetting higher DIO, indicating better working capital efficiency.  <br>- External challenges included COVID-19 impacts, geopolitical tensions (e.g., Russia sanctions), and supply chain disruptions affecting inventory and labor markets.  <br>- Asset impairments and write-downs in 2020 influenced inventory management practices, contributing to higher DIO in 2022.  <br>- RTX prioritized cash flow management through receivables optimization, supplier term extensions, and working capital strategies to navigate economic volatility.

        Raytheon Technologies Corporation has shown consistent growth in net sales and significant improvement in net income over the past three years. The company's profitability ratios, such as net profit margin and return on equity, have also seen enhancements, indicating better cost management and efficient use of assets. Although there is a decline in gross profit margin and some concerns with inventory turnover, the overall positive trends in sales growth, profitability, and solvency suggest that the company is well-positioned for future earnings growth. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that next year's earnings per share will increase.
