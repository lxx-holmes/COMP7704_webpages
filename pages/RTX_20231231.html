          - No significant changes in percentage of total revenue analysis (all shifts within ¬±5% range).  <br>- Gross Profit decreased by 11.55% from $13,668M in 2022 to $12,089M in 2023.  <br>- Income from Operations declined by 35.3% from $5,504M in 2022 to $3,561M in 2023.  <br>- Net Income fell by 38.5% from $5,197M in 2022 to $3,195M in 2023.  <br>- Total liabilities increased to 62.11% of total liabilities & equity in 2023 (up from 53.26% in 2022), with 18.63% YoY growth.  <br>- Shareowners' equity dropped to 36.96% of total liabilities & equity in 2023 (down from 45.72% in 2022), a 17.68% YoY decline.  <br>- Total equity decreased to 37.96% of total liabilities & equity in 2023 (from 46.69% in 2022).

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net Profit Margin decreased from 7.75% (2022) to 4.6% (2023) due to higher production costs, unfavorable contract estimate adjustments (EAC), and external factors like sanctions and supply chain disruptions.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin declined from 8.2% to 5.16%, driven by operational inefficiencies and increased costs from Pratt & Whitney's Powder Metal Matter requiring accelerated inspections.  <br>- Gross Profit Margin dropped from 20.37% to 17.55% primarily due to increased cost of sales and reduced pricing power.  <br>- Return on Assets fell from 3.27% to 1.97%, and Return on Equity from 7.01% to 5.2%, reflecting lower net income from operational challenges and external pressures.  <br>- Unfavorable EAC adjustments in Pratt & Whitney‚Äôs segment increased costs due to issues like the Powder Metal Matter, contributing to operating losses.  <br>- Sanctions, supply chain disruptions, and military program costs led to higher expenses, including credit losses and inventory reserves.  <br>- Management acknowledged the need to improve cost management and operational efficiency to reverse profitability declines.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current ratio decreased from 1.085x (2022) to 1.035x (2023) as current liabilities rose from $39.1B to $46.8B, outpacing asset growth.  <br>- Quick ratio declined from 0.814x to 0.783x due to operational challenges (Powder Metal Matter, supply chain sanctions) reducing liquid asset coverage of short-term obligations.  <br>- Cash ratio fell from 0.159x to 0.141x despite cash/cash equivalents increasing from $6.22B to $6.59B, as liability growth dwarfed cash reserves.  <br>- All liquidity ratios remained above solvency thresholds but showed weakening capacity to meet obligations, signaling short-term financial health erosion.  <br>- Significant cash outflows for capital expenditures, investments, and share repurchases further pressured liquidity despite maintained solvency.  <br>- Operational disruptions and accelerated liability growth highlight need for improved working capital management and cash flow prioritization.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio rose from 1.16 (2022) to 1.68 (2023) due to $4.5B new long-term debt, $4B term loans, and $12.7B equity decline (including $10.1B share buybacks), increasing financial risk.  <br>- Interest Coverage ratio fell from 4.31 to 2.37 as EBIT dropped from higher costs/expenses, reducing capacity to cover interest payments despite stable operating cash flow.  <br>- Debt-to-Asset ratio increased from 0.53 to 0.62 due to higher debt and reduced equity, shifting asset financing toward debt reliance and worsening solvency.  <br>- Solvency deterioration reflects strategic debt-funded activities (share repurchases, debt repayment) coupled with earnings decline, raising leverage and weakening long-term debt obligation capacity.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) increased from 54.4 days (2022) to 64.4 days (2023), indicating reduced working capital efficiency.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) rose 7.8 days to 57.4 days in 2023, driven by slower customer payments due to economic challenges and supply chain-related delivery delays.  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) increased 3.1 days to 75.6 days in 2023, attributed to supply chain disruptions affecting raw material procurement and production delays.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) saw a marginal increase to 68.6 days (2022: 67.7 days), insufficient to offset DSO/DIO impacts.  <br>- Supply chain issues from macroeconomic/geopolitical factors and Pratt & Whitney's Powder Metal defect (requiring accelerated engine inspections) exacerbated inventory/receivable challenges.  <br>- Operational strains included increased costs from customer support for defect-related disruptions and delayed inventory turnover.  <br>- Longer CCC reflects weakened cash flow efficiency, contributing to operating profit decline and highlighting need for improved working capital strategies.

      <p>
        <!-- Your text goes here. -->
        The company's financial performance has shown a decline in key profitability metrics such as net profit margin, operating profit margin, and gross profit margin. Additionally, there has been an increase in costs and expenses, including cost of sales and R&D expenses, which have negatively impacted net income and EPS. The company's leverage has increased, as indicated by a higher debt-to-equity ratio, and the cash conversion cycle has lengthened, suggesting inefficiencies in working capital management. These factors, combined with external challenges like supply chain disruptions and inflation, are likely to continue affecting the company's profitability, leading to a decrease in EPS next year.
