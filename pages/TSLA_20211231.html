          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Net profit margin increased from 2.29% (2020) to 10.25% (2021) due to higher revenues and cost management, with R&D expenses maintained at 5% of revenue and SG&A expenses decreasing from 10% to 8% of revenue.  <br>- Gross profit margin rose from 21.04% to 25.28%, driven by 65% growth in automotive sales revenue from 433,815 additional Model 3/Y deliveries and cost efficiencies from localized production in China (Gigafactory Shanghai).  <br>- Operating profit margin doubled from 6.32% to 12.12%, supported by automotive gross margin improvements (25.6% to 29.3%) and higher-margin services/retail merchandise sales.  <br>- Return on Assets (ROA) surged from 1.38% to 8.89% through $5.55B increased operating cash flow and optimized asset utilization at Gigafactories.  <br>- Return on Equity (ROE) jumped from 3.24% to 18.28% due to net income growth and reduced leverage (debt-to-equity ratio improved from 1.28x to 1.01x via $5.20B debt repayments).  <br>- Debt-to-equity ratio decline reflects a shift toward conservative capital structure, with no equity offerings in 2021 and focus on operational cash flow.  <br>- Operational scalability in China and cost control measures contributed to $12.72B automotive cost reductions despite 48% growth in energy storage costs.  <br>- SG&A expenses grew 44% YoY but became proportionally smaller (8% of revenue vs. 10%), demonstrating improved operational leverage.

          - Current ratio declined from 1.88 (2020) to 1.37 (2021) due to $5.5B current liabilities increase outpacing $0.4B current assets growth, but remains above 1 indicating short-term obligation coverage ability.  <br>- Quick ratio dropped from 1.49 to 0.995 as accounts payable/accrued liabilities surged from $2,102M to $4,578M and deferred revenue increased, reducing liquid asset coverage.  <br>- Cash ratio fell from 1.36 to 0.89 due to $1.8B cash reduction from investments in property/equipment ($6,069M) and digital assets/marketable securities purchases.  <br>- Operating cash flow of $11,497M was offset by $7,868M investing outflows and financing activity net outflows, straining reserves despite strong operational performance.  <br>- COVID-19 disrupted supply chains, potentially slowing asset conversion to cash and increasing operational costs, exacerbating liquidity pressures.  <br>- All liquidity ratios declined but remain within acceptable ranges, requiring ongoing monitoring of liability management and cash preservation strategies.

          - Debt-to-Equity ratio improved from 1.28 (2020) to 1.01 (2021) due to $422M and $474M convertible note settlements via 5.3M/6.5M stock issuances, reducing liabilities while increasing equity.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio surged from 2.67 to 17.58, driven by EBIT growth from $1,994M (2020) to $6,523M (2021), reflecting stronger profitability and debt service capacity.  <br>- Adoption of ASU 2020-06 accounting standards eliminated remaining debt discounts on convertible notes, reducing interest expense recognition and improving profitability metrics.  <br>- Capital structure shifted toward non-recourse debt (secured by subsidiary assets) from recourse debt, lowering financial risk and enhancing long-term stability.  <br>- Issued new lower-cost debt (e.g., 2024 Notes at 2.00% interest rate), reducing overall borrowing expenses and refinancing risks.  <br>- Strategic debt restructuring and equity expansion improved investor/creditor appeal by demonstrating balanced leverage and effective risk management.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) improved from -6.7 days (2020) to -25.8 days (2021), driven by enhanced working capital efficiency through faster collections, inventory turnover, and extended supplier payment terms.  <br>- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) decreased from 21.8 to 12.9 days, reflecting faster customer collections via improved accounts receivable practices (e.g., payment term adjustments or incentives).  <br>- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) declined from 60.0 to 52.2 days due to accelerated inventory turnover, including a $106 million inventory write-down to clear excess stock.  <br>- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) increased from 88.5 to 90.9 days, indicating extended supplier payment terms to retain cash longer and improve liquidity.  <br>- Combined DSO reduction (-8.9 days), DIO improvement (-7.8 days), and DPO expansion (+2.4 days) collectively strengthened cash flow efficiency and working capital management.  <br>- Negative CCC progression highlights Tesla's ability to generate cash rapidly, supported by operational improvements in receivables, inventory, and payables management.

        Tesla's earnings per share (EPS) are expected to increase next year due to strong revenue growth, improved gross and operating margins, and effective cost management. The company has demonstrated significant profitability improvements, with net income attributable to common stockholders rising substantially. Additionally, Tesla's efficient cash flow management, balanced capital structure, and strong financial health indicators such as the debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratio support continued positive performance. While there are risks associated with industry competition and supply chain challenges, Tesla's current trajectory suggests sustained growth and profitability.
