          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross profit margin improved slightly from 25.3% (2021) to 25.6% (2022) due to pricing adjustments, $365 million sales return reserve release in 2021, and sustained cost control measures.  <br>- Operating profit margin increased from 12.1% to 16.8%, driven by a $571 million (13%) reduction in SG&A expenses, including lower stock-based compensation and employee-related costs.  <br>- Net profit margin rose from 10.3% to 15.4%, supported by 430% higher interest income, 49% lower interest expense, and reserve releases boosting automotive revenue.  <br>- ROA improved from 8.9% to 15.3% as revenue grew 51% ($53.8B to $81.5B) and operational efficiencies enhanced asset utilization in manufacturing.  <br>- ROE surged from 18.3% to 28.1% due to net income doubling ($5.5B to $12.6B), reserve releases, and potential impacts from stock splits/buybacks noted in financial statements.  <br>- Total revenue increased 51% year-over-year, driven by higher automotive sales/leasing and operational scale effects.  <br>- Expense reductions included $571M in SG&A savings and 49% lower interest expenses, improving overall cost structure.  <br>- Manufacturing efficiency gains and operational streamlining contributed to better asset productivity and profitability ratios.

        <h3>Liquidity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Current Ratio improved from 1.37 (2021) to 1.53 (2022) as current assets ($27.1B to $40.9B) grew faster than liabilities ($19.7B to $26.7B), driven by inventory doubling and higher receivables/prepaid expenses, enhancing liquidity.  <br>- Quick Ratio declined slightly from 1.08 to 1.05 due to increased reliance on inventory (excluded from the ratio), tempering liquidity improvement despite overall asset growth.  <br>- Cash Ratio dropped from 0.89 to 0.61 as cash reserves decreased ($17.6B to $16.3B) amid rising liabilities, likely due to investments in property/equipment, reducing immediate cash coverage of obligations.  <br>- Inventory more than doubled during the period, contributing to current ratio strength but reducing the proportion of highly liquid assets in quick ratio calculations.  <br>- Accounts receivable and prepaid expenses increased substantially, further boosting current assets but not directly improving cash-based liquidity metrics.  <br>- Reduced cash reserves highlight potential short-term flexibility risks despite stronger overall liquidity from asset management improvements.

          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio decreased from 1.012 (2021) to 0.816 (2022) due to $819M debt repayment (including Solar Asset Notes), $29M debt-to-equity conversion, and equity growth from stock issuances/retained earnings.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio surged from 17.58 (2021) to 71.45 (2022) as EBIT doubled to $13,656M and interest expenses fell to $191M (from $371M in 2021).  <br>- Debt extinguishment charges in 2022 increased short-term costs but reduced long-term debt obligations, contributing to solvency improvement.  <br>- EBIT growth (+109% YoY) and reduced leverage reflect strategic focus on profitability and debt reduction, strengthening long-term financial stability.  <br>- Equity position improved via retained earnings and capital raises, lowering reliance on debt financing.

        <h3>Efficiency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Tesla's Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) shifted from -21 days in 2021 to 0 days in 2022, indicating reduced efficiency in converting inventory to cash due to slower inventory turnover.  <br>- DSO increased from 10 to 12 days (2021 vs. 2022), reflecting slower collections as accounts receivable rose from $1,913 million to $2,952 million.  <br>- DIO surged from 43 to 64 days, driven by higher inventory levels ($5,757 million in 2021 to $12,839 million in 2022) and early production of new models like the Tesla Semi.  <br>- DPO increased slightly from 74 to 76 days, with accounts payable growing from $10,025 million to $15,255 million, indicating marginally extended supplier payment terms.  <br>- The negative CCC in 2021 signaled faster cash generation than usage, while the 2022 neutral CCC reflects balanced cash flows amid inventory buildup.  <br>- Slower inventory turnover (21-day DIO increase) was the primary driver of the CCC deterioration, outweighing minor changes in receivables and payables.

        Tesla's earnings per share (EPS) are expected to increase next year due to strong revenue growth, improving profit margins, effective cost management, and a solid financial position. The company has demonstrated consistent growth in revenues, gross profit, and net income over the past three years. Additionally, Tesla's ability to control operating expenses and improve operational efficiency, along with a healthy balance sheet and improved solvency ratios, supports the expectation of continued growth in EPS.
