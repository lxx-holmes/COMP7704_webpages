          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Gross Profit Margin decreased from 25.6% (2022) to 18.25% (2023) due to higher production costs from factory expansions and competitive pricing pressures.  <br>- Operating Profit Margin fell from 16.76% to 9.19% as R&D expenses rose 29% (Cybertruck, AI) and SG&A increased 22% (labor, infrastructure).  <br>- Net Profit Margin remained stable at ~15.5% through effective tax management and non-operating cost controls despite gross/operating margin declines.  <br>- ROA declined from 15.26% to 14.07% as asset growth (factories, machinery) outpaced net income growth, reflecting capital expenditure impacts.  <br>- ROE dropped from 28.07% to 23.95% due to equity growth exceeding net income expansion.  <br>- Operating cash flow decreased $1.47B due to lower net income, partially offset by working capital adjustments.  <br>- Investing cash outflows rose to $8.90B (2023) from $7.16B (2022) for factory expansions and product development.  <br>- Financing cash inflows increased via $3.93B debt issuances and reduced debt repayments ($2.01B less vs. 2022).  <br>- Energy/storage segment gross margin improved from 7.4% to 18.9% driven by Megapack margin gains and IRA tax credits.  <br>- Foreign currency exposure risks persist due to unhedged global operations.  <br>- R&D expenses grew 29% in 2023 for Cybertruck pre-production and AI/autonomous driving development.  <br>- SG&A costs rose 22% from workforce expansion and facility-related expenses.

        <h3>Solvency Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          <!-- Your text goes here. -->
          - Debt-to-Equity ratio improved from 0.816 (2022) to 0.686 (2023) due to a $17.93B increase in equity (retained earnings rose to $27.9B in 2023 from $12.9B in 2022) and stable debt levels despite new asset-backed notes and terminated lease credit facilities.  <br>- Interest Coverage Ratio declined slightly from 71.4 to 57.0 as EBIT dropped to $8.89B (2023) from $13.66B (2022) due to higher automotive costs and increased R&D ($3.97B vs. $3.08B) and SG&A expenses, partially offset by lower interest expense ($156M vs. $191M).  <br>- Equity growth was driven by stock issuances for compensation and retained earnings, while debt management included balancing new debt issuances with facility terminations.  <br>- Operational cost pressures (including $3.97B R&D and rising SG&A) reduced EBIT, impacting the Interest Coverage Ratio despite strong overall solvency.  <br>- Tesla maintains robust debt management with a 33% equity increase and manageable debt levels, ensuring stable interest coverage capacity.

        Despite Tesla's revenue growth, the significant decline in gross and operating margins, coupled with increased operating expenses and higher production costs, may lead to a decrease in earnings per share next year. Additionally, the one-time tax benefit in 2023 might not recur, further pressuring EPS.
